Amir [holding a cigarette, trying to sit down backwards in an office chair]: Ahh... what are you doing?

Jake: Don't do that.

Amir: Pull me out. Push my leg. Hold the-- hold the chair, and then I'll push my leg.

Jake: Just sit regular. I don't wanna...

Amir: OK, but I'll...

Jake: Just sit normal.

Amir: Half backwards.

Jake: Nope.

Amir: Long day, right?

Jake: Yeah.

Amir: What are you doing the rest of the day?

Jake: Uh, nothing. I mean, what are you doing?

Amir: I mean, I'm holding a cigarette. Don't judge me.

Jake: I'm not. I'm asking what you're doing the rest of the day.

Amir: Sorry, mom. Some things are too cool for school, Daddy-o. Oh God, people smoke. Sorry if this freaks you out!

Jake: Doesn't.

Amir: It should.

Jake: All right, smoke it right now.

Amir: Psh, I wish I could. I wish I could smoke it right now. So smooth, tastes like milk. But I can't, 'cause I don't have a lighter. If I had a lighter, that would be the only...

Jake [taking out a lighter]: Here's one.

Amir: Jesus Christ, man, put that away! You're gonna light this on fire, get us arrested! [taking the lighter] Just give it to me already. You don't even know how to do it. [using the lighter, which works fine] Doesn't work. I wish it would, 'cause then I could toke this baby. 

Jake: It works.

Amir: Plus it's green, which means it's gay, so I'm not gonna use it to light my cig. Watch this. 

Jake: Don't.

Amir: Swish! [throws the lighter] Straight cash.

Jake: I'm gonna go get the lighter, I'm gonna come back, and then we're gonna smoke it for real.

Amir: [breaking the cigarette] Forget it, it's broken. Now we can't. And I'm all jittery, I'm all stressed out, I need another one. You owe me a cig. You owe me two cigs.

Jake: No, this is still smokeable.

Amir: No way, you don't know how to do it. You can't-- psh, half a cigarette?

Jake: [lighting the cigarette]

Amir: All right, very funny. Stop, stop! Look, it's all red now! Come on, I quit! I'm gonna sit regular. I just-- I quit! Let's go get drunk. Let's go to a bar. I'm buying the shots.

Jake: I'm going back to work.

Amir: Don't! Let's go to a bar... Jake, come back! I'll smoke again if you want me to.
