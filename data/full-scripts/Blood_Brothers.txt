Amir: I thought of Halloween costumes for us.

Jake: What?

Amir: Blood brothers.

Jake: Number one, Halloween is two months away. Two, we're not dressing the same, and three, blood brothers isn't a costume.

Jake: Don't! I'm- What is that?

Amir: Uh, this is just a key, but I'm ready to do it with a pin if you are.

Jake: Alright, I'm not.

Amir: Ok.

Jake: Not even close.

Amir: You're just saying that to impress your friends.

Jake: What friends? What are you talking about?

Amir: Any friend. Anything.

Jake: Are you just, like, repeating stuff you heard on T.V. again?

Amir: Why do I feel like I'm the only one working on this?

Jake: Ok, so you are. I think I probably just shouldn't talk to you.

Amir: Maybe you should.

Jake: Ok, you're talking really strangely.

Amir: Definitely. 

Jake: Ok, see, it's like, even that, it seems like it makes sense, but it doesn't.

Amir: I guess I'm acting weird because I lost a brother today.

Jake: You mean like a blood brother?

Amir: Yeah.

Jake: Ok, that doesn't count.

Jake: Do it.

Amir: No. It really hurt last time.

Jake: Thought so.
