AMIR: (in a Bob Dylan voice) -ther round, people, wherever you roam, and admit that the waters around you have grown, and accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone, if the time to you is worth sav-- (mumbles to the tune; Jake takes some Ibuprofen) --or you'll sink like a stone, and the times they are amazing.

JAKE: Times they are a-what?

AMIR: (takes off his headphones) Timestheyareawhat? (trying to do the a loser says 'what' joke)

JAKE: What'd you say?

AMIR: Times they are a...mazing? Eheh.

AMIR: (continuing the tune) ...Jude. (points at Jake)

JAKE: So you do know Jude is in there.

AMIR: Yes, definitely.

AMIR: Sad as.. sad as hell.

JAKE: That's a bad thing. Heh.
