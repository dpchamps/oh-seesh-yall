JAKE: Hey, what's that, uh, killer away mess that you throw up when you have to go #2?

AMIR: Dropping brown babies off at the pool, why? 

JAKE: That's it. I'm going to throw that puppy up there right now. 

AMIR: Come on, don't. 

JAKE: Sorry, bro.

(Pat begins laughing, followed by Dan, then Jeff, Streeter and the entire office. They all crowd around Jake applauding and cheering and then hoist him up and begin chanting his name as they carry him around)

AMIR: Come on, you gu- (Amir gets kicked in the chin by Jake, waking up in the now empty office. It was all a bizarre dream. It is dark out.)  Brown babies is mine.  

JAKE: What are you talking about? It's 9:30, go home. 

THE END.
