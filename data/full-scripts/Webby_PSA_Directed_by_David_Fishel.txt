JAKE: Hi, I'm Jake and this is Amir and we're--

AMIR: Teach your children not to hate. 

JAKE: Well--



JAKE: Hi, I'm Jake and this is Amir and--

AMIR: Please vote!

JAKE: We already did a voting PSA.

AMIR: It's never too late to vote.

JAKE: It is, actually. Now it's too late to vote. 

AMIR: For next election. 

JAKE: It's too early, then. 



JAKE: Hi--

AMIR: Because nobody has to go hungry, unless they want to. But even then, it's like a weird gray area, right? Because at which point do you say--

JAKE: Shut the fu--



JAKE: Hi--

AMIR: I'm Jake. 



JAKE: Hi--

AMIR: (singing) as a kite, I just might, stop to check you out. 

JAKE: OK, done. Stop it. 



JAKE: And we're here to tell you that the deadline to accept submissions--

AMIR: Oh, let's do one where I do a sick-ass cartwheel. 

JAKE: No.

AMIR: OK. 



JAKE: Hi, I--

AMIR: (singing) Baby go on! 



JAKE: Hi, I'm Jake--

AMIR: Let's do one where I have the award. (takes the award from Jake) Give it. 



JAKE: And we're here to tell you that the deadline--

(Amir jumps up and attempts to do a cartwheel)

JAKE: Amir, don't!

AMIR: AHH-OW!



JAKE: We just want to say that the final--

AMIR: Ow. 

(pans out to show Amir sitting on floor by couch holding neck)

AMIR: Oh god, I'm really sorry, I don't want to ruin it, but I (sighs) I really hurt. I'm not happy with this. Hehe, I'm not happy with how it turned out. 

JAKE: Me either. 

AMIR: I know. (chuckles) I'm trying to be a good sport but it hurts a lot. 



(Amir is lying on couch shirtless with his head on Jake's leg)

JAKE: So the final deadline to accept submissions--

AMIR: (muttering and singing) Baby, go on, like a blister in the sun. (chuckles) Ah, sheesh. 

JAKE: Relax, right? You're in pain. 

(Jake pats Amir's head then tries to push him off his leg)

AMIR: OK, y-y-yeah. Ow, hey, I found a perfect spot, don't move me. You can do it, but don't move me.



(Amir and Jake are standing by the door of the room, Amir is still holding his neck with one hand and the award in the other)

AMIR: That was OK. I think we got it. I think we got everything we need. 

(they open the door to leave, Amir heads out first)

JAKE: Yeah, good work. 

(Jake goes to follow Amir, then turns around to face the camera)

JAKE: (softly) Hey, I'm jake, and that was Amir. We just want to say that the final deadline to accept your Webby submissions is December 19th.

(Amir comes back into frame)

AMIR: Who are you talking to?

JAKE: Nobody. 

(Jake leaves the room and Amir slams himself into the door coming back in)

JAKE: Relax! 

THE END.
