Mom, close the door! Rotate it. Rotate it, right? Anyway, uh, a lot of you guys have been complaining that there's not a lot of super villains in these episodes, which is a great complaint, which is why, today, Ace and I are gonna foil the plot of an evil scientist who's ugly and-

PAT: No, you never said that I was gonna be ugly.

AMIR: What? Argh, what are you...? 

AMIR: In this episode, Ace is gonna be confronted by an evil, hideous scientist who can't handle a camera or keep his mouth shut for the life of-

PAT: Alright, I'm leaving.

AMIR: W-w-w-w-wait, c'mon! Hey, Patrick! Patrick! C'mon! I'm gonna edit that part out!

PAT: You said you didn't know how to edit.

AMIR: I'm really sorry. I mean-

PAT: I'm sorry, too. I don't understand why you're- 

AMIR: I know. This is... I'm... this is probably so weird for someone like you, who has this, like- 

PAT: Someone... what does that even mean?

AMIR: Put on this hat and I swear everything's gonna be alright. Just, put on the hat and-

PAT: Do you have my money?

AMIR: Yes, yes, I really do, I promise. I swear to God I have your money, just, good, excellent, put on the hat and follow me, bitch.

PAT: You're sure he knows we're coming?

AMIR: Yes, or I don't know, just, can you open the door? You know- do you know your line even?

PAT: Of course I know my lines! What are we even doing?

AMIR: Will you get...?

JAKE: Is there somebody there?

AMIR: Shh, just get in there, I'll say the rest.

PAT: Alright.

JAKE: I'm gonna kill you!

AMIR: Oh my-

PAT: Oh my God!

AMIR: Ace.

JAKE: Amir?

AMIR: That was-

PAT: Oh my God!

AMIR: ... so good! Ace, I led him right to you.

JAKE: I'm so sorry.

AMIR: You would have been so proud.

JAKE: Put this on, put this on on your eye.

AMIR: Ace.

PAT: Ah!

JAKE: I'm so sorry.

AMIR: The astronaut accountants strike again!

JAKE: This is... Amir, is this... is this that stupid pilot thing that you're doing?

PAT: Guys-  

AMIR: Let me-

PAT: ... I think I'm blind! Guys, I think I'm blind.

AMIR: Justice.

JAKE: Hey, guess what? You're a double agent.

AMIR: What?

PAT: Guys, I think I'm blind.

JAKE: You're a double... you're a double agent, Ace-

AMIR: No way.

JAKE: ... or Jocelyn, or whatever the fuck your name is. 

AMIR: I would never-

PAT: Jake, take the cell phone out of my pocket.

AMIR: Ace, get the cell phone out. Don't, yet. This is so messed up, right now.

JAKE: This, this right here, this is a finger-blasting gun and it shoots invisible lasers and I'm gonna shoot you.

PAT: Guys, I think I'm blind.

AMIR: I know WHAT IT IS! JUST RELAX, ACE, PUT IT DOWN!

PAT: I already know the insurance.

JAKE: Get on your knees, right now. Get on your knees. 

AMIR: This isn't supposed to happen, not until season two.

JAKE: You have ten seconds to get out of here-

AMIR: Ace.

JAKE: ... crawling on your knees like a dog, before I shoot you in the face-

AMIR: I don't wanna do this... but I've a real knife!

AMIR: Will Ace ever come to his senses? Is Jocelyn really a double agent? 

PAT: Please, stop talking.

AMIR: Will the evil, ugly scientist shut up and let me finish? All these answers and one more next week on Ace and Jocelyn, astronaut accountants from outer space.
