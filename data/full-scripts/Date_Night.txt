INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching a very sexy episode of Jake and Amir!

JAKE: Hope not.

AMIR: Sexy!



[Amir is at a restaurant on a date. He and his date are sitting in uncomfortable silence. She brushes her hair away from her eyes, and in response, Amir makes a face as if he's straining to hear something she said.]

AMIR: [almost inaudibly] Hm?

[Amir's date just shakes her head. They sit in silence for a while longer, and then she yawns.]

AMIR: And I win! You spoke first, and thus I have the upper hand now.

AMIR'S DATE: I didn't say anything.

AMIR: Power play. [chuckles] What's so funny, maggot?

AMIR'S DATE: Nothing.

AMIR: Look, this isn't my first rodeo, okay? I'm on Tinder, Grindr, GROWLr, OKCupid, SoGayStupid, Twinge, Hinge, JDate, JSwipe, YouPorn, JYouPorn... I've seen it all, honey. What's your poison?

AMIR'S DATE: "Twinge"?

AMIR: I have not heard of that one. Is that a digestif?

AMIR'S DATE: You said Twinge. I don't know what that is.

AMIR: [to the server] Let's get my date a wine, and I think I will have... twinge.

[The server pours Amir's date a glass of wine. As he stops pouring, Amir tips his hand back the way it was, filling the glass to the very top. Unable to pick it up without spilling it, Amir's date leans in to sip from it.]

AMIR: So here's what I'm gonna offer you: [holding up a wad of bills] this is five hundred dollars in cash, and it's yours if you leave right now.

[She grabs the cash and begins counting.]

AMIR: Just know that if you do take the money and run, that's it. You can't come back. No more second date. Sort of a coy little way to figure out if my dates are in it for the long Paul! [holds up a picture of Paul Dano]

[Amir's date leaves with the money.]

AMIR: ...No one's ever not taken the cash.

[Cut to black.]

AMIR: Fuck.



[The rest of Amir's night is presented in a melancholy montage. Amir walks home, twitching with frustration. For lack of any emotional outlet, Amir lunges at a homeless man to try and make him flinch. The man lunges back, growling. Amir screams and runs away.]

[Amir enters his dark apartment and locks the door. He kicks one shoe off and tosses it into the corner, then flops down on his bed. He kicks off his other shoe, and it nearly hits him in the face. By his bedside table, we see that Amir has several pictures of Jake.]

[Amir unbuckles his belt and puts his hand in his pants. He masturbates while staring listlessly at the ceiling of his apartment.]

AMIR: [orgasming] Oooo!

[Amir opens a packet of barbecue sauce and puts it on some chicken nuggets for himself.]

[Amir stares into the mirror, holding a toothbrush with toothpaste on it, and contemplates brushing his teeth. He shakes his head, and puts the toothbrush back down, throwing the toothpaste tube onto the sink counter with it.]

[Amir lies in bed, still numb. A framed picture of him and Jake sits in the background on his bedside table. Amir quietly begins crying.]



[Amir comes in to the office the next day, and sits down in the chair in solemn silence. Jake stares at him, waiting for something.]

AMIR: [suddenly as energetic as ever] Got laid last night! [laughs]
