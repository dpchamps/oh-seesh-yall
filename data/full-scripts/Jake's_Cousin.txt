INTRO:

AMIR: (trying to do the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" theme) In west Philadelphia two best friends hanging out and have fun-

JAKE: Stop! Stop.


(Amir is sitting at his desk. Jake walks in with his younger cousin, Madeiline.)

JAKE: (to Madeleine) Alright, and this is my desk. Pretty fun, right?

AMIR: Haha, pretty fun right? (sternly) Introduce me!

JAKE: Alright, Amir this is my cousin Madeleine.

AMIR: Oooo, somebody's gonna get their period soon!

JAKE: Hey! Hey! Don't say stuff like that!

MADELEINE: I already had my period.

AMIR: It's nothing you should be ashamed of. That's all I'm gonna say.

JAKE: Okay, she's not ashamed.

AMIR: She should be, a little, but...

JAKE: (to Amir) Okay, you just said she shouldn't be. (to Madeleine) Madeleine, it's perfectly natural.

AMIR: I- I'd be ashamed.

JAKE: Oh my God! You should be ashamed.

MADELEINE: I got it when I was twelve. It's not a big deal.

AMIR: That's early, that's way early!

MADELEINE: No it's not.

AMIR: Who told you it wasn't?

MADELEINE: My mom.

AMIR: She's a lying bitch! Jake?

JAKE: Dude, that's my aunt! You can't say stuff like this!

AMIR: Do you not want me to be real? Okay, I'm a lot of things, but you can't say that I'm not honest.

JAKE: Yes I can. You just told her she had nothing to be ashamed of, then you went off on this rant.

AMIR: I can apologize for being mean, but I'm not gonna mean it.

MADELEINE: You're a loser.

AMIR: You're- Okay, Jake? Whose side are you gonna take, man?

JAKE: Hers.

(Amir scoffs.)

AMIR: You know, it was unfair of me to ask you this early in the game; take the weekend to think about it.

MADELEINE: You're dumb.

AMIR: (to Jake) Choose me, please. Please choose me. I have- she's cutting me deep and I need to hear that I have a friend right now.

(Madeleine makes a face at Amir. Amir makes the same face back at Madeleine, which Jake sees.)

JAKE: (to Amir) Will you please grow up?!

AMIR: Shuh-! She did it first, that stupid bitch! 

JAKE: Wow! Alright, we are gonna go. We have Christmas shopping to do.

AMIR: Ooo, what's the matter? Santa Claus not workin' this year? Oh yeah, I forgot: he doesn't exist. 

MADELEINE: I knew that already.

AMIR: What? I was bluffing. Jake. Jake!

JAKE: (to Amir) He's real! He's real.

AMIR: (to Madeleine) Shouldn't-- Shouldn't say that, you're not gonna get any toys.

END.
