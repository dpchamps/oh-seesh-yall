Jake (talking on phone): Yeah, I don't know. It's a little weird. Uh, I'll let you know. Alright, I'll tell you later.

Amir: What was that about?

Jake: Uh, this girl, that I'm kind of interested in, but we've been friends for a really long time-

Amir: (laughs) Honestly, I'm not even listening. That's how little I give a shit.

Jake: I open up like an inch, and you just-

Amir: Alright, want some real advice? 

Jake: Sure.

Amir: This is what you do. It might come off as a little disgusting, or whatever-

Jake: Ok, then don't say it.

Amir: Ok, eat her pussy.

Jake: Oh, god, wish you didn't say that. Now I'm thinking about it.

Amir: Jakes.

Jake: I'm right here. We're having a conversation. Don't say my name in the middle of a conversation. 

Amir: Yeah.

Jake: Ok. Yeah. We have a meeting to go to. Come on.

Amir: Not going to that meeting, partner. 

Jake: Why?

Amir: I'm supposed to refresh the homepage over and over, and if it breaks, tell one of the programmers about it, so...

Jake: So, yeah, they had me do that like my first day as an intern, they told me I was way overqualified. 

Amir: Yeah, well, I guess they think I'm perfectly qualified for it then, so...

Jake: You know, it's not even worth insulting you because you just don't get it. 

Amir: Jake.
