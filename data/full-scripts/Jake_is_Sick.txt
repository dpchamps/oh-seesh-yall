No intro

[Camera shows Jake and Amir's desks are empty, then pans to the rest of the CH crew who are seated playing a game. ]

Streeter (yawning): You guys notice how nice and quiet it is today?

Jeff: Yeah, 'cause Jake and Amir aren't here.

Dan: Okay, they are really fucking weird right? 

All: Yes! Absolutely!

Sarah: Amir is sooo weird.

Streeter: You know what? It's not just Amir. Jake is totally insane. I lived with that guy. Certifiable, for sure.

Jeff: They shit at the same time every single day.

All (in agreement): Yes!

Pat (pointing newspaper): I thought I was crazy.

Sam: That's not true. Jake goes to the bathroom. Amir follows him to the bathroom.

Sarah: No way!

Streeter: No. No. No. Not all the time 'cause sometimes Amir goes in before him. 

Dan: A couple hours before.

Pat: Sarah, how do they shit at the same time?

Sarah: What...

Sam: Who am I, who am I right now?

[Sam tilts his head to the side.]

Sam (imitating Amir): Jake, dinner tonight?

[All laugh.]

Pat (earnestly): Amir. Amir. Amir. You're Amir.

Sam: Yes, I'm Amir.

Streeter (high pitched): Look at me talk in a high voice. I'm annoying 
everyone in the office...



Note: I can't really tell who's talking here.



They all start imitating Amir. Here's what I can make out.

Pat: ...right now!....must go bother someone...completely bother the entire office...

Jeff:...and I've got a huge crush on Sarah.

Sarah: What?

Guy: Watch this. Who am I guys?

[He stands up and stuffs chicken nuggets in his mouth.]

Guy (high pitched): Ooooh. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. 

[All laugh]

[Amir is revealed behind him and silence falls on the group.]

Jeff: Oh.

Amir: Hahahaha. Sup, hey guys?

Other: Hey man.

Sarah: Uhhh... where were you today?

Amir: Uhhh... Jake is actually very sick. (looks at Pat) Not that that's any of your business.

Pat: I didn't say anything!

Amir: So this is what you guys do huh? When Jake and I aren't here you do a little impersonations, you eat chicken nuggets, right? You do impressions of people and that's fun. 

Sarah: Sorry Amir.

Amir: You know what, don't be. ' Cause I love doing impressions too! laughs Who am I? 

Amir (doing a bad impression of Jake): Pat, you know what? Your hygiene is less than average and I don't like you anymore. Amir is my best friend, did you guys know that? 

Amir: I'm Jake. Give me a chicken nugget.
