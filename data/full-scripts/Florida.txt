Amir (missing ping pong ball with paddle) Jake! Uh, going to the bathroom?

Jake: Actually, I'm glad you're here. Check this. (starts clapping, raps to the hand claps) My name's Amir, and I'm a loser.

Amir: (trying to clap along) I like this beat.

Jake: And no one likes me.

Amir: Whooh! Except for most people.

Jake: And I will never steal Jake's wallet again.

Amir: I like the beginning of that song, but I can nay promise the end of it.

Jake: You should be able to.

Amir: I'll see you tomorrow. 

Jake: You won't. I'm going to Florida. 

Amir: As am I.

Jake: Oh, really? Because last time I checked, I was going to Florida with my friends, and you're not my friend.

Amir: Last time I checked, you were going with your friends, your cousin Diana, and your cousin Diana's date; me, Amir. Blumenfeld. Blumenfeld is my- Blumenfeld is my last name, FYE. 

Jake: FYE?

Amir: For your advice. 

Jake: Ok, so, wrong phrase, wrong word, and it wouldn't start with an E.

Amir: You know, if you're gonna keep this up, I don't even think I should go to Florida. 

Jake: That'd be awesome.

Amir: (slaps Jake) We're even.

Jake: We're far from even.

Amir: (slaps Jake again) Mph, I don't want to have to do that again.
