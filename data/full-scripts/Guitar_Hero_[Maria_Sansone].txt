(Scene is an office party, with Jake, Amir, and Maria Sansone in the foreground)

Amir: Have you guys ever played this?

Maria: Um...

Amir: Um.... Well, if you haven't, let someone else play, ok?

(Jake and Maria are playing Guitar Hero)

Jake: Go.

Maria: Ok. Oh!

Amir: (chuckles) Oh my god. You got it.

Maria: (laughs) Yeah!

Amir: You're pretty good for a mildly retarded chimpanzee.

Jake: Stop.

Maria: I'm on the left, right?

Amir (mocking Maria): I'm on the left?! I'm on the left! (laughs) I swear she's mental. How do you not know you're on the left or right?

Maria: Oh my god, I am!

Jake (helping Maria): Red. Red.

Amir: Red red green green yellow yellow red. No, no, no, no, you're off! You're off! You're off!

Streeter: Yes, shut up! Shut up!

Amir: Ugh, it kills me because I'm so good to see someone suck so hard! Ugh!

Streeter: No one can hear the song!

Amir: Yes, they can hear the song! 

Streeter: No one can hear the song when you're yelling!

Amir (to Jake): Do it with your eyes closed, because I can do this song with my eyes closed.

Streeter: Dude, stop! 

Maria: I can't see!

Amir (yelling over Jake and Streeter): You don't have to see, it's Guitar Hero! You fucking listen! Take it off! (takes guitar from Maria)

Streeter: They failed! Are you happy they failed the song?

Maria: (leaving) (to Jake): Your friends are crazy.

Amir (to Maria): I'll let you do the hammer thing. Ok, good. Good riddance, baby. Watch this. 

Streeter: Great, great! Now the girl's gone. Thanks, dude. 

Jake (over Amir's screaming): Nobody wants to play with you, man. 

Amir: Crank this shit up to medium.
