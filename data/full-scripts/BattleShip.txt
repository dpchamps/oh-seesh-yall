Amir: (Talking into the phone) A3. D2. D4.

(Jake is at the vending machine on the other end of the phone, having just purchased a Milky Way)

Jake: Okay, you sunk my Milky Way.

Amir: (Eating a Milky Way) So fucking sick.

Jake: Can we stop? I'm down like eight bucks.

Amir: We'll stop when the machine's empty. B2!
