Amir: Jake, question. Is it Jake with one 'j'?

Jake: Yeah, one 'j'.

Amir: That's it?

Jake: There's an 'a' and a 'k'â€”

Amir: Okay there's an 'a' and a 'k'... slow down! What order is everything in?

Jake: What is wrong with you?

(Julia (Julia Allison) enters and shakes Jake's hand)

Julia: Hi, I'm Julia from HR.

Jake: Oh hi. Nice to meet you!

(Music starts playing and the screen goes pink around around the edges. Julia lets down her hair gets onto Jake's lap.)

Julia: You're amazing.

Jake: Second best to Amir, but thanks.

Julia: I have an island off the coast of Nebraska; wanna run away with me?

Jake: Cannay do that, sister. Amir's my BBF [sic] and I don't go anywhere without him.

Julia: Don't you wanna rub your toes all over my breasts?

Jake: Of course I do, that's the most hot normal fantasy ever, everyone knows that.

(The pink border goes away, and Amir is leaning back in his seat, eyes rolled back and mouth wide open)

Julia: Is he okay?

Jake: Uh, yeah. He actually does that all the time.

(The pink border comes back)

Jake: And it's pretty much awesome! (High fives Amir)

(The pink border goes away. Amir, still fantasizing, high fives the air. The pink border comes back.)

Jake: Amir can do a backflip, he just won't show us cause he's too shy.

Julia: Kiss me.

Jake: Amir beat me at arm wrestling three times today.

Julia: No he didn't.

Jake: Two out of three and he used both hands, but that's legal.

Julia: No it's not!

Jake: Amir!

(The pink border goes away)

Amir: Jake!

Julia: Are you okay?

Amir: He doesn't want to go to that island with you, you fucking biznatch!

Ricky: Amir!

(Amir tilts his head back and fantasizes)

Ricky: I want you to go camping with Jake in the Ice Cream Forest.
