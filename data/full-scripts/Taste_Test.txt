Jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.

Amir: And I bet you I can eat this microphone. 

Jake: No no no no.

(Amir chokes)

Jake: Oh god, no no!

Amir: Okay.



(Jake and Amir are sitting at a table with some food on it. Jake finishes putting a blindfold on Amir.) 

Jake: Alright. Do you know why you're here? 

Amir: Oh sheesh y'all, t'was a dream! 

Jake: Okay. 



Jake: You crying? 

Amir: No!



Jake: I'm gonna give you a blindfolded taste test, see if you like some new food, and hopefully we can expand your diet. 

Amir: Okay, I do expand it already, so. I eat mo' and mo' chicken noogets every day.



Jake: Here we go. (Feeds Amir a piece of pineapple)

Amir: Och. Blach. Oh my god.

Jake: How is it?

Amir: Tastes like a cold and sweet... like a wet chicken nugget or something.

Jake: That's a pineapple.

(Amir spits it out onto the floor)

Amir: Needs barbeque sauce.



Jake: Alright, this is kinda like a chicken nugget: grilled chicken.



(Amir is holding the grilled chicken)

Amir: The shape is good. Honestly, the shape is good, but I'm gonna put it on the floor for now. We'll file it under 'F' for floor.



Jake: Man.

(Amir tries some water and spits it onto the floor)

Jake: Oh!

Amir: Oh, god! What is this, poison?!

Jake: It's water!

Amir: It's so... not salty.



Amir: Alright, next thing better not be green because I swear I'm allergic.

Jake: That's impossible.

Amir: Yeah I thought so too, until I ate that moldy piece of bread last week. Remember?



(Jake is putting down the water)

Amir: Uhhhhhh...

Jake: Don't be sad, it's fine. It's fine.



Amir: Alright, untie me you fool!

Jake: You're not tied up.

Amir: Oh. Yeah. My hands feel really weak.

Jake: It's probably your diet.

Amir: Yeah, probabl—well, definitely my diet.



Amir: Alright, just put it in my hand and I'll put it in my mouth.

Jake: Fine.

(Jake puts a piece of broccoli in Amir's hand and he throws it away)

Jake: You're not even gonna try to be discreet, huh?

Amir: Nay.



Amir: Oh my god, I'm blind!

Jake: You're blindfolded.

Amir: No, it's even darker here than yooj!

Jake: Try opening your eyes.

Amir: Okay, I'm not an idiot, okay, it's not—ah.

Jake: What did you do?

Amir: Uh, nothing. I just adjusted something, nothing you told me to do. Bitch.



Amir: Wanna just chill in here for a little while and talk smack about Jeff?

Jake: So you forgot why we're here in the first place.

Amir: I think it's quite obvious I have.



Amir: Ready.

Jake: Ready, here you go. (Puts the chicken in Amir's mouth, or rather, just between his teeth)

Amir: Yummy!

Jake: That one good?

Amir: Yeah, supa.

Jake: You like that one?

Amir: It's a good one.

Jake: That's a good one. You like it a lot

Amir: Yeah.

Jake: Put it in your mouth, all the way.

Amir: Nah.

Jake: Put it in your mouth all the way and eat it. You're not chewing it. You're not chewing it. You're not doing anything.

(Amir spits it out)

Amir: Well it tastes like garbage!



(Jake is holding a chicken nugget)

Jake: Chicken nugget. Do you think I was gonna feed this to you accidentally?

Amir: I don't know what you're talking about, so.

Jake: Alright, well, here we go. (Feeds Amir a cauliflower)

Amir: Mm. Yummy.

Jake: You like that?

Amir: Yeah.

Jake: That's cauliflower, man. Amir?



(Amir is choking Jake on the table)

Amir: I f**king trusted you you son of a bitch!
