INTRO:

AMIR (high pitched): Hi, my name is Jake and you're watching my best friend and me do comedy videos.

VIDEO:

(Jake and Amir are sitting down in the office)

AMIR: OK! Focus please, we only have an hour to do this.

JAKE: You're just repeating what I said, OK, that's not helpful.

AMIR: OK, you know what else isn't helpful? The tickle monster!

(AMIR raises his hand to tickle JAKE)

JAKE: If you tickle me I'm gonna punch you in the head.

AMIR (going into tickle JAKE): Aah!

(JAKE swings to punch AMIR, who dodges his punch)

AMIR: Hoho! Swing and a-

(JAKE swings again, this time he punches AMIR in the nose)

AMIR: Aah!

JAKE: Sorry.

AMIR (holding his nose): Dang it!

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: You got me that time.

(AMIR's phone starts to ring)

JAKE: Gotcha.

AMIR (pulling phone out of pocket): Ooh, snap--
(AMIR reads phone, takes hand off nose)
I gotta get this.

JAKE: Take it. It's fine.

AMIR (getting up): I shall be right back.

(The phone starts to ring again. AMIR goes to try and tickle JAKE again. JAKE swings to punch AMIR but he jumps back in time)

AMIR: (Laughing) Oh, I'm sorry. You. Are. Too. Slooow. (Laughs)

(AMIR walks into side room and closes door)

AMIR (yelling, crying): Noooo! No! No! No! No! No! (Cries) Why!

(JAKE sits outside, looking uncomfortable)

AMIR (breaking down): I can't have this! Not today! (Cries) I love you so much! (Cries) Please, please call be back! Why! Why, why, why!

(AMIR instantly regains composure, he opens the door and returns to JAKE)

AMIR: Sup!

JAKE: Is everything OK?

AMIR: Yes! (Rapping) Let's get down to business, I don't got a (inaudible) Hell yeah! (laughs)

(AMIR's phone rings again, AMIR groans)

AMIR: Sorry! Again.

JAKE: Fine, get it.

AMIR (walking away): BRB, in the Middle E. I shall be right back. I will call you back mother-fucker.

JAKE: I told you it was okay.

(AMIR closes door)

AMIR (yelling): You are not getting a dime of this money! Not. One. Dime! Understood?

(JAKE is sitting outside blocking his ears)

AMIR: I have killed before, I will kill again, that is not the issue! Call me!

(AMIR instantly regains composure and returns outside)

AMIR: Bonjour madame. (Laughs)

JAKE: Uh, madame is girl. I really- I can just finish this up on my own.

AMIR: No? What? Nonsense!

(AMIR's phone rings)

AMIR (growing angry): Oh my gosh!

(Pause as AMIR considers something)

AMIR (calmly): I'm blowing up.

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR (singing to the tune of Get the Party Started): I'm blowing up so you better get the party started.

(JAKE joins in at the end)

AMIR (still singing): I'm blowing up, I'm blowing. (Laughs)

JAKE: Go ahead.

(AMIR closes the door and answers the phone)

(AMIR starts yelling in what sounds like a mixture of Hebrew and English)

AMIR: Nie! Nie you! You are over, you understand me? (Maniacal laughter)

(AMIR starts screaming and jumping around before regaining composure and opening the door)

AMIR: Uh. (Knocks on door, laughs) Hey, I'm gonna have to take off a little bit early today-

JAKE: Yeah yeah that's fine.

AMIR: Ok.
