(Amir returns to desk in penguin costume...quacking)? 

AMIR: Where is she? (nervous chuckle)?

JAKE: Amir...

?AMIR: What happened?

?JAKE: I need to talk to you. 

?AMIR: (puts on penguin hood) What about?

?JAKE: Diana told me something.

AMIR: If this is about me, wearing your high school retainer, I did it as a joke...wow! You don't even wear it anymore! ?

JAKE: She wants to break up with you. ?

AMIR: (chuckles)

?JAKE: Umm...

?AMIR: Why wouldn't she do it herself?

?JAKE: Sh-She probably likes you too much. 

AMIR: I can't believe this. I mean, you read plays, you see commercials, you never think it's going to happen to you.  ?

JAKE: It happens to everybody.

?AMIR: Nobody should ever outlive a relationship with somebody else, especially her.?

JAKE: I'm trying really hard to--

?AMIR: Can I be serious with you for a second? ?

JAKE: (sighs) Probably not. 

?AMIR: I thought she was the one. 

JAKE: OK, I was right.

AMIR: I'm sure she was.

JAKE: All right, what do you mean by 'the one'?

AMIR: What do you mean?

?JAKE: What is 'the one'?

?AMIR: The one, whatever. The one...well I don't know, you just say it. You just say it and the girl smiles and kisses you on the cheek...(whines) OH GOD THIS SUCKS! 

?JAKE: All right, come on, uh, dinner tonight. ?

AMIR: No.

?JAKE: McDonalds, let's go, right now!?

AMIR: I don't feel like it. 

?JAKE: (sighs) OK, well, whatever you--

?AMIR: Well which McDonalds?

??(cuts to them at McDonalds) 

(Jake feeds Amir a nugget)

?AMIR: Ugh, god, a dry McNugget, huh?! A dry McNugget! As if my day wasn't going bad!?

JAKE: I'm sorry!

?AMIR: It's fine. Ugh! Sweet and sour first! Sweet and sour first! ?

JAKE: I'm sorry. 

?AMIR: There's a difference. 

(Blackout)

AMIR: Thank you for doing this today, and every day for the rest of the year, as you promised!

JAKE: I didn't say that.

THE END.
