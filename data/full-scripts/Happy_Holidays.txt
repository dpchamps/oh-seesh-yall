INTRO

AMIR: Jake, Jake, Jake, J-Jake, Jake, J-Jake, Jake.

JAKE: Say your own name.

AMIR: And Amir.

JAKE: God.

AMIR: Happy?



(Jake is sitting at desk, Amir wheels in a large wrapped box)

AMIR: (grabbing Jake, rapping) Uhh, happy holidays, and so grab yourself a hoach-gay.

JAKE: I though we said we weren't doing gifts this year.

AMIR: Why not?

JAKE: Because every year you've gotten me something really weird.



(flashback three years ago, Jake and Amir are on couch)

AMIR: So I got you something.

JAKE: Thanks, man.

AMIR: Uh, you know how you told me the story about when your dad was a kid he had a kaleidoscope and it broke?

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Or, uh, he had a kaleidoscope and he lost it in the snow or something?

JAKE: No, that wasn't me.

AMIR: And, like, ever since then you've been trying to find him a kaleidoscope to replace the one that broke?

JAKE: I'm not even sure I know what a kaleidoscope is.

AMIR: (handing Jake small, wrapped cylinder) Anyway, just, just open it, it's gonna shock you to the core.

JAKE: (shaking it, makes broken glass noises) It sounds really broken.

AMIR: Impossible.



(flash forward to two years ago, Amir giving Jake a brown bag filled with cash)

AMIR: So I'm like what do you get the guy that has everything? Why not cash, the gift certificate to anywhere?

JAKE: There's, like, over a thousand dollars in here.

AMIR: Yeah, why? Do you think I stole it?

JAKE: I do now.

AMIR: From an old lady? (Jake sighs, Amir grabs Jake's sweater) This is nice.



(flash forward to last year, Amir is giving Jake a large animal crate)

JAKE: Thanks.

AMIR: Go home and, (taps crate) you'll appreciate this cage more.

JAKE: What?

AMIR: Just go home and, (taps crate) you'll appreciate this cage more.

JAKE: What do you mean? Not what you said.

AMIR: Let me put it in a way you might understand, without giving-

JAKE: Just say it.

AMIR: I got you a wolf.

JAKE: Ugh, Ok.

AMIR: Yeah, and I put it in your apartment.

(Jake sighs)



(flash forward to present, Jake sighs)

AMIR: Ok, just trust me. This year is gonna be different. Just open it, please.

JAKE: Alright.

(Jake rips wrapping paper to reveal cardboard box. Amir pops out of box holding collar.)

JAKE: Ahh! What? How did you- What is that?

AMIR: It's a collar. 

JAKE: For what?

AMIR: For the wolf! For- FTW.

JAKE: I don't have the wolf anymore, Ok?

AMIR: For the- it's FTW, for the wolf.

JAKE: The wolf's dead, they euthanized it in my apartment. You wanna dig it up? For the wolf?

AMIR: For the epic wolf.

THE END

AMIR: (looks at camera) Merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah from Jake and Amir!

JAKE: (looking suspiciously at camera) Who are you talking to?

AMIR: Nobody.
