INTRO:
JAKE: Hey, you're watching J--
AMIR: --Hey have you seen my underwear?
JAKE: Just leave!
AMIR: I'm naked under here!
JAKE: I know!
[Jake is sitting at a table with Sarah, Cassidy, and two other women.]
SARAH: (laughing, to Jake) We are never inviting you into our room again, you only played '80s dance music!
JAKE: You say that like it's a bad thing!
SARAH: Well- (laughs)
CASSIDY: I can't use that (IS THIS EVEN A WORD???) I'm like too ADD.
SARAH: (laughing) I have the same--
AMIR: (suddenly appearing standing up beside them, almost yelling) I HAVE ADD.
(Everyone else cries out, startled)
AMIR: I have ADD, ADHD, rage.
JAKE: Where did you even come from?
AMIR: She said she had ADD, right?
JAKE: That doesn't answer my question.
CASSIDY: I said I'm "like" ADD.
AMIR: I have ADD. I have ADD, ADHD, rage,--
SARAH: Rage issues, or?--
AMIR: No, like rage, overall rage.
JAKE: Wow, every single item of clothing is backwards today, huh?
AMIR: I have panic, intestinal jaundice, webbed teeth,--
WOMAN 1: What's webbed teeth?
AMIR: Webbed teeth! (putting both index fingers by his top molars) That's when your back three molars on both sides are fused together, like that, plus two molars growing in off the roof of my mouth, sitting on my tongue, look at that. (pointing at his tongue)
JAKE: Jesus!
SARAH: So gross...
AMIR: I'm hard of tasting, hard of feeling, and guess what, I was just recently diagnosed with nasal scoliosis.
JAKE: Nasal scoliosis??
AMIR: Nasal frickin scoliosis, that's the thanks I get for being a good guy, no pat on the back, just a frickin pink slip and a diagnosis that says my nose is scoliosed.
JAKE: Nobody invited you into this room!
AMIR: I have an arthritic colon, facial cramps, and taint rosacea, which is not what it sounds like, cuz 'tis rosacea, on m'taint.
(The two other women get up and leave.)
AMIR: Oh!
JAKE: Oh, come on, girls, don't leave! We were having a nice little ladies' lunch!
AMIR: Come back! I haven't told you about my adult onset diarrhea, (laughing, turning back to Jake, Sarah, and Cassidy), you laugh, but I have that!
(Cassidy gets up and leaves, disgusted)
JAKE: No one was laughing, man, just you were laughing.
AMIR: It was funny! Ok I also have a receding anal hairline, a lung murmur, and dyslexia nervosa.
SARAH: Meaning?
AMIR: Meaning, I puke when I read and I read when I puke and I'm Popeye the Sailor Puke, TOOT TOOOOT (farts during the second "toot")
JAKE: You clearly farted during the second "toot"!
AMIR: I was with my mouth I went "TOOT TOOOOT"
JAKE: No I heard that but you also definitely farted!
SARAH: Yeah I can smell it.
AMIR: No..
JAKE: Yes--
AMIR: Nonononono
JAKE: --I can smell it too!
AMIR: It's not that!
JAKE: Stop denying it man, we can both smell it!
AMIR: It's my mouth, ok I have indigestional halitosis, here smell. (opens his mouth wide and breathes out onto them)
JAKE: (recoiling in disgust) Ohh!
(Sarah pukes onto the table)
JAKE: Oh, come on!
(Sarah wimpers)
JAKE: We were having such a nice ladies' lunch!
SARAH: (to Jake) You weren't even invited!
JAKE: I was invited!
SARAH: No.
JAKE: I was invited!
END.
