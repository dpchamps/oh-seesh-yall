Amir: Ahh! Ugh, come on! Ugh, focus!

Sam: So what's the plan? We get to Maimi? We find Jake, you and he become best friends, we all get matching tattoos?

Sam: Alright! For the tattoos I'm thinking Jake and Amir Foreva.

Amir: No, Sam.

Amir: No, I want it to say No, Sam.

Passerby: Yeah, a blowjob.

Jake: No—sorry that wasn't me. Though I wouldn't turn one down. No, I—well, I mean, I wouldn't turn one down, but I would only accept

Sam: Yeah, E stands for not enough gas, idiot!

Amir: So what's F?

Sam: Fine, for now, gaswise. The tank is fine.

Amir: Dang it! Ugh, god, this sucks!

Sam: I guess we could hitchhike.

Amir: What, are you crazy? We're gonna get murdered.

Sam: No no no, it's the hitchhikers that do the murdering.

Sam and Amir: (Jubilantly) We're gonna murder people!
