(The staff is gathered in the conference room)
Paul: Alright, alright, thanks for coming in everybody. Now obviously we don't have these all-hands meetings very often,  but this is pretty important. As a lot of you guys can remember, about a year and a half ago, one of our developers Kunal Shaw, was killed in a bus accident. Now I know a lot of you have guys have gone to grief-therapy and I honestly just wanted to open up the dialogue, Amir can you get up?
Paul: Amir, can you get up?
Amir: ..I'm plancking
Paul: Would you please show some respect?
Amir: You're not respecting me..
Paul: You don't earn my respect, you're acting like a child
Amir: Respect the planck Sir, or I'll make you walk it..
Paul: I'm not going to walk the planck
Amir:..meetee
Paul: I'm not!
Amir: Gnarrr!
Jake: hey, buddy..

Jake: What you're doing right now is worse than screaming
Patrick: And also you are screaming.
Girl: starts crying
Amir: Wow, okay someone's laughing
Jake: no, they're crying
Amir: It's not that funny, well maybe it is, I don't know ,I don't have a good vantage point
Jake: They're not laughing so hard that they're crying, they're just crying, somebody died.
Amir: Yeah, your sense of humor.. hahahha
Jake: No, Kunal
Amir: Here's a party tip, Y'all just committed a party foul, you're all arrested for disturbing the planck
