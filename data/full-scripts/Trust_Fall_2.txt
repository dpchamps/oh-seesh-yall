[Intro]

AMIR: Hey, you're watching - let's keep it at that!

JAKE: Let's say our names-

AMIR: Oh, NOW you care!

[AMIR walks up to JAKE.]

AMIR: Jake.

JAKE: Hey.

AMIR: Can I trust you?

JAKE: Yeah, why?

[AMIR stiffens up and falls backwards.]

JAKE: No- DUDE!

[AMIR lands hard on the floor.]

AMIR: You must feel like such shit, I trusted you and you let me down!

JAKE: No, not really.

AMIR: I'll tell you how you can make it up to me.

JAKE: I just told you I didn't feel bad.

AMIR: I registered at Sky Mall!

JAKE: Are you even hurt?

AMIR: Emotionally?

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Yes. Physically?

JAKE: Yes.

AMIR: No.

AMIR + JAKE: ...What?

AMIR: I sent you the registry, dude! Just get me something off of it and we'll call it Even Steven Segal.

JAKE: Yeah, I'm not gonna get you anything off of the Jake Fucked Me registry.

AMIR: I don't know why not, 'cause you did!

JAKE: Why do you even want a Nunsmere Bronze Elephant Trunk Sconce?

AMIR: I'm sexy and I know it!

JAKE: This is extor-

AMIR: Girl look at my body!

JAKE: What you're doing right now-

AMIR: Girl look at my body!

JAKE: It's legally blackma-

[AMIR now has a pair of sunglasses on.]

AMIR: Girl look at my body!

[Long pause.]

JAKE: I have all the time-

[AMIR has regular glasses again.]

AMIR: I work out!

JAKE: Here's a question, what are you gonna do if I DON'T get you a gift?

AMIR: MURPH!

JAKE: Aaaiieeeurgh! Chill, man!

[MURPH walks up to JAKE.]

MURPH: What's going on here, guys?

JAKE: Dude, yeah right, no way.. Nothing.

MURPH: You didn't, uh... You didn't catch Amir there, huh?

JAKE: You know what, Murph? I've been working out, so I've got news for you: You come at me, I'm gonna run away so fast, that I'm gonna tell on you!

MURPH: ..Are you a bitch, Jake?

JAKE: No!

AMIR: Yeah.

JAKE: Yeah, I don't know, what do you.. what do you want me to say?

MURPH: If you're a bitch, I think you should tell EVERYBODY that you're a bitch.

AMIR: Agreed.

JAKE (quietly): Come on, man, I'm- I'm a bitch, what do you want?

MURPH: Say it... like I didn't TELL you to say it.

[Pause. Jake looks nervous.]

AMIR: Say it.

JAKE: I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, come on!

MURPH: When you say come on, it sounds like you're saying it for me. Don't say it for me! I don't want to hear it! EVERYONE wants to hear that you're a bitch, Jake!

[Brief pause.]

MURPH: Say it.

JAKE: I'M A BITCH! I AM, I REALLY AM! I'M A BITCH, OKAY?! I'M A HUGE FRIGGIN BITCH! Are you happy?

MURPH: Now you buy me and Amir that bronze elephant trunk wall sconce, and we call it Even Steve Seagal.

JAKE: Come on, you want one too?

MURPH: THEY'RE TASTEFUL AS FUCK, BRO. You got a problem?

JAKE: Okay, this is bullying, and I DO have to take it!

[JAKE chuckles.]

JAKE: But you know what? I'm drawing the line, AND I AIN'T BUYING YOU YA GUYSES WALL SCONCES, alright?

[JAKE pulls out his wallet.]

JAKE: Here's my wallet, you can use my money, but you're buying your own damn sconce! Think fast.

[JAKE tosses his wallet in the air. MURPH slams it into the floor, near AMIR. AMIR flinches.]

JAKE: Weak, dude! Weak!

MURPH: Fall back. Trust me.

JAKE: No, no-one's gonna catch me!

AMIR: I did it!

MURPH: Cross your arms and fall backwards. Trust me.

JAKE: Fine, fine, just let me take off my studded belt.

MURPH: Oh, god...

JAKE: I'm only wearing it because it's laundry day!

MURPH: You wash your belts?

JAKE: Do you want me to fall, or not?

MURPH: Put it on inside out.

JAKE: WEAK!

[JAKE puts the belt on inside out.]

MURPH: Next notch.

[JAKE puts the belt onto the next notch.]

MURPH: NEXT. NOTCH.

JAKE: Dude, it really kills.

MURPH: Suck in.

[JAKE sucks in his gut and puts it on the next notch. He groans loudly.]

MURPH: Now fall.

[JAKE prepares himself, then falls. MURPH somehow appears behind him and catches him. Dramatic music plays.]

MURPH: I will ALWAYS catch you, Jake.

[MURPH stares into the distance.]

JAKE: ...What the fu-
