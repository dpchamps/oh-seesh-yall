INTRO

AMIR: Sup?

JAKE: You're watching Jake and Amir right?

AMIR: Sup?

JAKE Stop.

AMIR SU-rry...

JAKE is working at his desk; AMIR enters wearing a cowboy hat. He awkwardly sits down and takes off the hat.

AMIR [Boastfully]: Ohh, hats off to me.

JAKE: Whoa! New haircut.

AMIR: Yes sir [laughs] what do ya think? 

JAKE: You're kidding right?

AMIR: Yeah, I'm kidding [laughs] why am I kidding?

JAKE: It's obviously terrible 

AMIR [in a funny voice]: I know it, don't I know it?

JAKE [in the same voice]: Then why'd you get it?

AMIR: I got it because I needed a haircut but the girl obviously messed up bad!

JAKE: So you sit down you were like; 'oh hey maam can I have the worst haircut ever?'

AMIR [defensively]: No! I didn't which is why I'm going back there today and demanding my money, comes back to me.

JAKE: Sounds about right, good job.

AMIR: I'm gonna walk in there and be like look-

JAKE [Interrupting]: You don't have to say anything, yeah, when it's that bad you just walk in. You walk in and you're like PSSH!

Jake gestures to his hair.
Amir shoots Jake a finger gun In agreement.

AMIR: Sounds about right, sounds about right.

JAKE: Yeah

AMIR: What should I do until then because right now it's stuck in this bad state right?

JAKE [shaking his head]: I don't know dude.

AMIR [Aggressively/fighting back tears]: Well don't say 'I don't know dude' ehh? Because right now you're the only person who's actually telling it like it is so what do you think I should do?

JAKE: I don't know what you want me to say.

Amir slams his hands onto his desk violently.

AMIR [Yelling]: Just give me some frikken advice okay? Everyone else is sugar coating it they're all like 'oh nice haircut bro, looking good' but I obviously don't okay? So please I need you right now just tell me what to do I don't know what to do! 

Amir slumps his head onto the desk and starts loudly sobbing. 

JAKE: Stop- It's fi- 

Amir continues to cry.

JAKE: Dude I got you!

Amir stops crying

JAKE: Gotcha! Buddy?

Amir looks up, sniffling.

AMIR: I got you.

JAKE: I was kidding, your-you got me?

Amir cracks a smile

JAKE: Got me.

Amir is still struggling to keep from crying

JAKE: Look at you; you're not really sad.

Amir shakes his head.

JAKE: You don't care. 

AMIR [still upset]: I don't give a crap.

JAKE [positively]: That's good; we've got each other!

AMIR: I got you...

JAKE: We've got each other.

AMIR [urgently]: We HAVE each other.

JAKE: We got each other

AMIR [Panicked]: We have each other!

JAKE: We got...okay, we have each other we have each other! We have eachother we have each other!

Amir slumps his head down onto the desk again.

JAKE [Singing]: We have each other, we got the world...

Amir joins in
