INTRO

JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir-- and watch out, dude.

AMIR: Dude, I am watching out, dude!



[Jake and Amir are in a car. Amir is driving. Amir looks over at Jake expectantly.]

JAKE: Look-- [pointing at the road] ...Jesus.

[Amir gestures at somebody outside.]

AMIR: Learn how to drive, shitbird!

JAKE: That guy's walking.

AMIR: Call me a shitbird again. Call it to my face and see what happens.

JAKE: Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.

AMIR: Yeah? Well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! And last time I checked...

JAKE: "I'm have a pussy"?

AMIR: [simultaneously] ...I'm have a pussy. Yeah!

JAKE: Yeah, you've said that before.

AMIR: Exactly right. Can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? Alright? Music helps me drive!

JAKE: Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.

AMIR: I'm sorry if music distracts me! I think that's pretty normal, actually.

JAKE: Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.

AMIR: [mocking Jake] I-- I--I know how to drive, alright? I'm a regular James Deen.

JAKE: Jesus.

AMIR: What?

JAKE: Jerk.

AMIR: I can't... you know what?... I can't see anything. I think I need my sunglasses.

JAKE: Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--

AMIR: No, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em.

[Amir leans way back into the backseat to look for his sunglasses. Jake grabs the wheel.]

JAKE: Hey, hey-- hey-- dude! Hey! Idiot!

AMIR: I got 'em, dude! I g--

JAKE: You idiot!

AMIR: Why am I an idiot? Okay? There's a lot of glare. It'll be much safer if I just find my shades!

JAKE: Eyes on the road, buddy.

AMIR: I don't need 'em on the road, buddy! Alright? Relax. I--

[Jake shushes Amir.]

AMIR: [singing] Beware, beware, beware...

JAKE: Find the glasses.

AMIR: [singing] ...of a woman with a broken fart! [farts loudly]

JAKE: Oh! Smelly!

[Amir sits back in his seat, wearing heart-shaped sunglasses.]

AMIR: Got 'em, baby!

JAKE: Jesus Christ.

AMIR: Pussy-whipped much?

JAKE: ...What?

AMIR: I swear, dude. You let women walk all over you. You gotta--

JAKE: I don't-- ...stop it. Okay?

AMIR: Okay...

JAKE: I don't feel like having a conversation right now.

AMIR: Me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. [pronouncing "page" in French]

JAKE: Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.

AMIR: Fine. [pause] It's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive. [chuckles] Was sittin' in the same seat you were. If you can belee dat!

JAKE: I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--

AMIR: Cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. "Loser has to teach Queen Dweeb to drive!" That's what they said.

JAKE: "Queen Dweeb"?

AMIR: "Queen Dweeb". That was their nickname for me. They used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?

JAKE: ...The pit?

AMIR: Yeah. They used to throw knives at me.

JAKE: Why did you ask me about peach pits?

AMIR: Because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...Idiot!

JAKE: Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...

AMIR: Yeah?

JAKE: Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.

AMIR: [doing an arm signal] I use arm signals. [sticking his arm in front of Jake] Hi-ya! Less legal, sure--

JAKE: Eyes on the road.

AMIR: --but... way less effective, too.

JAKE: So you said "less" twice, then.

AMIR: Yeah. [chuckles] Oh, God, these driving lessons. Daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. "I don't want to drive today, Papa! I can't reach the pedals!"

JAKE: ...Excuse me?

AMIR: I was four.

JAKE: God, your parents suck, dude.

AMIR: Excuse me! Say that again! Say that again to my face and I will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!

JAKE: Keep your eyes on the road!

AMIR: I can't see shit, dude! These glasses are not prescription!

JAKE: Then take them off!

AMIR: [leaning back into the backseat again] Let me put them back in the case!

JAKE: Hey! Dude!

AMIR: What, dude! Drive, shitbird!

JAKE: Hey! Come on!
