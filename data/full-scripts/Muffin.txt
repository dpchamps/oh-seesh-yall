Jake: It's an apple walnut muffin so apples, wal...

Amir: [interrupting] Oh no! [choking noise], I'm allergic to apples! [choking noise]

Jake: Ok if you're allergic to apples then just spit it out.

Amir: [choking noise] Well I'm allergic to other stuff, what else is in this?

Jake: What else are you allergic to?

Amir: Walnuts! [coughs] Eggs, yeast, flower, milk, muffins.

Jake: Alright, so you're listing things that are in muffins and then you also said muffins so definitely spit it out.

Amir: Peas

Jake: You're probably safe there but I'd still spit it out.

Amir: I can't spit it out, ok! My throat's closing! Why did you give this to me?

Jake: I didn't give it to you, you took it from me, knowing full well it was an apple walnut muffin.

Amir: [pointing to Jake's iMac] Well that's an apple walnut computer, you don't see me eating that.

Jake: Did you think my muffin was a computer?

Amir: I just realised I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die because of the muffin because of you; There's gonna be blood on your hands!

Jake: You're not gonna die!

Amir: I'm gonna die just like that president did.

Jake: What President died from a muffin?

Amir: [in a normal voice] Fun fact, Millard Fillmore.

Jake: Not true.

Amir: [starts choking again]

Jake: Spit it out! Spit it out!

Amir: My throat's closing, I can't spit it out!

Jake: [gets up and starts clawing the muffin out of Amir's mouth]

Amir: [disgusting choking noises]

[Jake finishes getting the muffin out of Amir's mouth]

Amir: Have you seen the new Facebook redesign? It's really whack; it's so bad.
