Amir: Wow, I am, so sorry, i had no idea it would be that bad.
Amir: Jake.
Throws toilet roll at Jake
Amir: Jake I said i was sorry. What else do you want me to do, i  don't deserve this silent treatment.
Jake:Alright look, just don't talk to me for the rest of the day alright? I don't want to hear from you.
Amir: Can i least show you what the wrestling move would have looked like, if you didn't ruin it.
Jake:Absolutely not.
Amir: The thing is you were scared last time, if you could just conquer that fear, I think, it will look, really, really boss.
Jake:You probably should have explained to me that you were going to do a wresting move, and explain to me what I was supposed to do, right?
Jake:That's what your supposed to do...
Amir: Uh, your head goes in between my thighs and I suplex you off the table, and, listen my knees will hit the floor before your face, so don't brace your fall.
Jake:I'm not letting you do any wrestling moves on me, you obviously can't do them correctly.
Amir: I mean that splint is just as much your fault as it is mine, if not more yours because you're the one that actually put his wrist down
Jake:Don't talk to me anymore
Amir: Um, I wrote you a poem
Jake:Don't read it
Amir: We soared through the air
Jake: Don't read it.
Jake:Just tear it up right now and were even
Amir: You dont want to hear the rest of it?
Jake:Tear it up and throw it away.
Amir: If i tear this up were best friends.
Jake:OK, didn't say that, were just back to how it was before.
Jake:Here, give it to me.
Amir: You wanna, read it to yourself or something?
Jake rips it up
Amir: OK, uh whoah, huh OK wow uh stop, OK one second, i can still tape that back together.
Amir: Let me just get through the ending.
Amir: We soared in the air as two people but we landed as one.
Jake:Didnt hear that. putting on headphones
