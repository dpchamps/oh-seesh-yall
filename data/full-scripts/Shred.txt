Jake: What are you doing?

Amir: Why don't you pass the axe, bro? I'll show you how to really shred. Shred so hard.

Amir: Give me the triangle plastic disc.

Jake: The pick?

Amir: The disc, yeah, the dick. Pick.

Amir: Did you even, like, tune this axe? I taught myself how to play guitar.

Jake: Ok.

Amir: So. Pretty fly for a white guy.

Jake: Yeah, but, that wasn't you playing. That was Will. You just cut to a close-up of Will playing.

Amir: Nah.

Jake: Why don't you just play that same exact thing except no close-up shots, just a plain old shot of you playing.

Amir: Easy. 

Jake: Wanna take that disc and play?

Amir: It's a pick.

Amir: When I taught myself how to play guitar, uh, I knew two chords.

Amir: Hold on a second.

Jake: Just go up.

Amir: Stop, stop. This... you messed it up. 

Jake: I messed it up?

Amir: Yeah. And now...

Jake: Now everybody knows, so I did mess it up.

Amir: Honestly, when I came in here and you were playing guitar, I thought you were playing the electric guitar. This is the only guitar I know how to play.

Amir: I'm sorry for confusing you, how many times to I have to apologize to you?

Jake: You haven't apologized yet, but once is fine. 

Amir: I just, I'm starting to feel like crap around you, man. It's just, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

Jake: Nothing.

Amir: Like, I got 15% on Free Bird the other day, I activated super power and just didn't mean it.

Jake: Star power.

Amir: I can't even talk around you anymore. 

Amir: Ever since, I don't know, ever since she came I just feel like crap.

Jake: Who's she?

Amir: My Playstation 3.

Amir: I don't shred by taking things, like, easily, you know? Look at this.

Jake: Yeah.
