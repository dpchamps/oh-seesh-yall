(Jake and Patrick sitting on beanbag)

Jake: So you've, like, been chasing the same girl for three months?

Patrick: Right, exactly.

Jake: Yeah, and so this is what you got to do.

Amir: (farts)

Patrick: (laughs)

Jake: Oh god, that's digusting. 

Patrick: Epic. 

Jake: (gets up to leave)

Patrick: No, no, wait, wait. Finish what you were saying. 

Jake: Alright. What I'm saying is you have to plant a lot of seeds and see what grows, because there's no point in just having one girl on your radar.

Amir: Exactly. Listen. It's called the Amir theory.

Jake: Nope.

Amir: You gotta have girls on your radar. You plant seeds, see what grows, right? Sometimes it's a tree, sometimes it's a leaf. 

Jake: Shut up, Amir.

Patrick: No no, he's right. Sometimes it comes to fruition, and sometimes it doesn't.

Jake: No, you don't understand. He never really knows what he's talking about.

Jake: No, we're-

Patrick: (laughs) Good one. Thanks for the advice, one.

Amir: (laughs) Good one. Thanks for the advice, man.

Jake: You're not a monkey.

Amir: (monkey screech, hits Jake) AH AH AH!
