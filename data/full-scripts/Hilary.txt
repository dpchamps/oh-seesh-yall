[VIDEO]:


(HILARY is at her desk talking on the phone)

HILARY (on phone): Nope, that definitely won't work, it absolutely has to be-

(JAKE and AMIR are sitting opposite each other at their desks)

AMIR: Oh my god! I'm gonna kill her, I'm gonna kill her, I'm sorry!

JAKE: Who?

AMIR: Who? Who? Sarah! That's who!

JAKE: That's Hilary.

AMIR: Oh... OK well whatever man she's annoying as... WORMS!

JAKE (Confused): What?

AMIR: I dunno.

JAKE: She's a producer, OK? So part of her job is to talk on the phone. Just relax.

AMIR: OK, well I got something she can (air quotes) produce.

JAKE: What's that?

AMIR: (Pauses to consider) Worms!

JAKE: Stop saying worms?

AMIR (Angrily): Aaaaah!

(AMIR bangs the desk three times)

JAKE: What is the matter with you?

AMIR: Oh my god. Have you ever been so frustrated by someone at work that you just can't take it anymore?

JAKE: Every single day, for the last two years-

AMIR: Alright, F-it. Listen, I'm gonna go do some- I'm gonna go shut her up. I'm sorry.

JAKE: Don't do that.

AMIR: I'm not gonna hit her OK? Relax.

JAKE: I said don't do that before I thought you might hit her.

AMIR: Really?

JAKE: Look if you absolutely have to you can go other there and calmly, kindly ask her to please talk quietly.

AMIR: Fine.

JAKE: Amir. (Making eye contact) Eyes.

AMIR: Wha?-

JAKE: Gimme your eyes. I trust you.

AMIR: I love you too.

JAKE and AMIR: Trust you-

AMIR: -yes, I trust you.

(AMIR gets up and goes over to HILARY)

HILARY (On the phone): No, I just, I don't think that's gonna work for Win, I mean I have to-

(AMIR knocks on her desk)

AMIR: Hilary, Hilary?

HILARY: Yeah?

AMIR: Hi, I am so sorry, uh, Amir by the way I work over there with Jakey.

HILARY: OK...

(Simultaneously)


AMIR: Um hi...

HILARY: Hi...

AMIR: If you could just maybe- if you take that phone call somewhere else that'd be so helpful. 

HILARY: Sure...

AMIR: Or, or if even you have to talk here just talk like, half a decibel quieter?

HILARY: Hang on. (On the phone) Uh, Bob, lemme call you back. (Hangs up) 

HILARY: I'm so sorry about that!

(Simultaneously)


AMIR: No problem at all!

(AMIR slaps HILARY across the face, she gasps)

AMIR: Aah, go- (To JAKE, who rushes over) I'm so sorry dude, I tried, I really tried, it's just sometimes (Points to HILARY, through his teeth) Eeeh, you can't really do anything else with them-
