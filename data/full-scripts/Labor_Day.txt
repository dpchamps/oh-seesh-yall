AMIR: Labor Day.?

JAKE: Yup.?

AMIR: What did you do this long weekend?

?JAKE: Uh, went home, visited my family, you?

?AMIR: I went camping.?

JAKE: Sounds pretty fun, who'd you go with??

AMIR: I went-I went alone, I went by myself. 

JAKE: (chuckles) . . . Oh, you're serious.?

AMIR: Yeah.

?JAKE: Why would you do that?

?AMIR: Huh??

JAKE: Why would you go camping on your own?

?AMIR: I asked around, nobody really wanted to go, so . . . 

?JAKE: So the normal reaction to that is just not to go, right??

AMIR: Live and learn, I guess. 

JAKE: Where'd you go?

?AMIR: The Adirondacks.?

JAKE: God, that's like, 3 hours away.

?AMIR: Yeah, it's 350 miles north of here.

?JAKE: How did you get there?

?AMIR: I took a cab.?

JAKE: Jesus! Are you kidding me? How much was it?

?AMIR: Seventeen hundred dollars.?

JAKE: Oh my god, Amir! How do you have that kind of money to waste? 

?AMIR: I don't. ?

JAKE: Jesus, you look really sick. ?

AMIR: I am, I know, I haven't eaten in three days. ?

JAKE: Yeah, you look really pale. Did you not bring food?

?AMIR: No. I mean I thought I'd catch a fish or something. 

?JAKE: Are there even lakes up there?

?AMIR: No, that's the worst part. I had to like, follow squirrels and try to club them over the head with a fishing rod.?

JAKE: How did you get home?

?AMIR: (screams in pain) My leg! 

?JAKE: You can't change the subject.?

AMIR: I took a cab.?

JAKE: . . . god. 

THE END.
