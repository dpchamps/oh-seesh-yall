(There's a thunderstorm, Jake and Pat are looking out a window)

PAT: Man, it's crazy out there.

JAKE: Yeah.

PAT: Hey, where's Amir?

JAKE: I'm not sure, I saw him before, but I don't know. 

(Jake walks away)

PAT (calls after him): Which is it? You saw him before, or you don't know?

(Jake enters office, Amir is hiding under the table)

JAKE: Yo.

AMIR: AH! 

JAKE: What are you doing in Ricky's office?

AMIR: Oh, am I? No, uh, I was . . . oh god, I was looking for a coin, I dropped a coin and   I'm going to find it. I'll be uh, out in hours, so. 

JAKE: How many hours?

AMIR: One. 

(Jake joins Amir on the floor)

JAKE: So you're afraid of the storm?

(Thunder claps)
AMIR: Noo-OOO!!

JAKE: No?

AMIR: Why? Storms just a, psh, whatever and thunder is uh, kind of scary, but whatever, it's just a noise, right? It's just a noise! 

JAKE: Yes.

AMIR: So.

JAKE: You're right. 

(Thunder clap)

AMIR: AHHHH!!!

JAKE: You OK? 

AMIR: Yeah, uh, I just stubbed my toe.  I keep stubbing it. 

JAKE: OK, you're lying down though. 

AMIR: Yeah, I'm lying down because it hurts so badly. So. Uh, could you do me a quick favor actually?

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: Yeah, I'm just going to put on these headphones, listen to music, close my eyes and wait for the storm to pass. Just come get me when the sun comes out, please? 

JAKE: OK, I'll do that. 

AMIR: OK, wh-wh-whoa, one more quick flavor and then you can bounce on out of here.  

JAKE: Sure.

AMIR: Stay. 

JAKE: What?

AMIR: St- I want you to stay. I'd like it for you to stay and then rub my back and wait for the sun to come out and then you can, psh, peace on out of here.

JAKE: OK, so you want me to stay?

AMIR:  Yeah, or you can do whatever you want, I don't care. Just stay. Just stay though.

JAKE: OK, what if I don't want to stay?  

AMIR: OK, what if I want to write Sarah a love letter and say it's from you? We can all do different things--

JAKE: And why would you tell her it's from you? 

AMIR: OK, then I'll just tell her it's from you. 

JAKE: OK, she wouldn't believe you.

AMIR: (high pitched) OK, fine, then we'll see.

JAKE: (also high pitched) Yeah, we will see, I guess we'll just see. I'll stay.

AMIR: OK, thank you. RUB IT COUNTER-CLOCKWISE, BITCH!

JAKE: It is counter-clockwise.

AMIR: Ooo...it is counter-clockwise, I'm such a tough guy- (thunder clap) - AHHHHH!!!! Sorry. Oh, my lord, I just peed a little in my pants. 

THE END.
