[INTRO]

Amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.

[pauses for Jake's reaction]

Amir: You're not going to say, Good job?

Jake: Jesus, man.



Amir: Hm, it's kinda hard to sit down with this knife in my back. Can you actually grab that for me? And don't twist it.

Jake: Just shut u-- Wow! There is a knife back here.

Amir: Okay.

Jake: It's covered in peanut butter.

Amir: I meant the imaginary one!

Jake: Still though.

Amir: I'm just nervous, you know? I love her so much and in a couple hours, she could just come in here, look me square in the eyes and go, You are the weakest link. Goodbye. [unexpectedly tapping Jake's stomach] Goodbye.

Amir: Hey, to pass the time, let's read old text messages between her and me.

Jake: No. Don't.

Amir: Last night was incredible. You made me feel like a woman again. I had no idea my breasts were so sensitive. Okay, now let's read one that she sent to me...

Amir: She's calling me! Hello? Oh my God! She's been in an accident!

Jake: Are you--

Amir: I'm kidding, you idiot.

Jake: Wow! What is wrong with you?!

Amir: What?

Amir: Hey, just so you know: Whatever happens, me and you are going to stay friends.

Jake: What if she chooses me?

Amir: Then we're through, okay? You're dead to me.

Jake: You just said whatever happens we'd stay friends.

Amir: Yeah. Sometimes I say stupid things. It's like, Hi. I'm Amir. Have we met? It's-- [gasps at seeing Lerona]

Lerona: Hey.

[Jake and Amir eagerly approach Lerona]

Lerona: So, I made my decision.

Amir: Who'd you choose?

Lerona: It was really tough. Jake, you're so thoughtful and smart and really cute... so I choose you!

[Jake and Lerona hug]

Amir: And Amir? You are...

Lerona: No.

Amir: So, I guess you made your decision.

Lerona: Yeah.

Amir: Well, let me just show you what you're going to miss:

[Amir leans in for a kiss and Lerona stops him by palming his face]

Amir: Hey! What are you doing?!

Lerona: I chose Jake!

Amir: I know. But I need to show you what you're going to miss!

Lerona: No. No. Listen, I'm... I'm really sorry.

Amir: Me too. Wait. No. I'm not sorry; I'm sad. You made me sad.

[Jake puts his arm around Lerona]

Jake: So.

Lerona: So...

[Jake and Lerona exiting building onto the street]

Jake: God, I'm so happy you chose me.

Lerona: I feel like such a bitch.

Jake: You're not a bitch.

[they kiss]

Jake: [as Lerona walks to stand in the street] Just like Aragorn said to Arwen before the Battle of Helm's Deep...

[a bus comes out of nowhere and hits Lerona]

Jake: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh no!
