(Amir sniggers)

Jake: What the hell, man? What is it?

Amir: Look at your desktop.

Jake: Oh my god!

Amir: (Laughing) Oh, man.

Jake: What is that?!

Amir: It's an old fashioned prank, son. It's my parents having sex, and it's on your desktop.

Jake: What?!

Amir: I put a picture of my parents having sex, and now it's on your desktop.

Jake: Hey that's not a prank on me, man.

Amir: What?

Jake: Sarah, look at this.

Amir: What are you doing?

(Sarah comes over)

Jake: It's Amir's parents having sex.

Sarah: Your mom's not even enjoying it.

Amir: Come on! Stop! This is a prank for you, not for her!

Jake: You guys!

Amir: Sto—okay, no.

Jake: Hey!

Amir: I don't want you to be embarrassed.

Jake: I know! Oh my god.

Amir: Come on.

Jake: I should send this out.

Sarah: Streeter!

Amir: Don't—come on! Stop it.

Jake: Cassels, come here!

(Pat comes over)

Amir: No, don't come here! Please! I'm be—Jake, I'm begging you, please do not come—it's not! It's a joke, it's a prank! Please! What 
are you doing?!

(Pat arrives at Jake's computer)

Sarah: [indiscernible] Amir Blumenfeld.

Jake: Amir's parents having sex.

Amir: Come on, stop. It's just a prank for you!

(Amir fiddles on Jake's computer to hide the photo)

Sarah: Jeff, look!

(Jeff looks)

Amir: There's nothing to look at!

(Jeff laughs. Amir puts Jake's monitor facing down on the desk.)

Amir: Prank over. Okay? Everyone had their fun, right?

Jake: Can you put my monitor back? Put it back up.

Dan: What's going on?

Amir: I wanna prank you, but you made me feel bad about it.

Jake: You know, for your next prank, you should just like, piss your pants in public. That would really get me.

Amir: You think so?

Jake: That would be pretty good. Is there another picture on here?

Amir: Don't open it!
