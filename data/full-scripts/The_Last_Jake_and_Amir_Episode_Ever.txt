INTRO

JAKE: Hey, thank you so much for watching Jake and Amir.

AMIR: Losers.

JAKE: Be grateful.

AMIR: I am!



[CollegeHumor has booked a theater for the premiere. The marquee outside reads "COLLEGEHUMOR PRESENTS: AMIR AND JAKE; A WEBSERIES ABOUT TWO BEST FRIENDS". Inside, Amir and Jake walk across the stage into the spotlight. The are met with applause from an audience of their co-workers.]

AMIR: Ladies... gentlemen... Paul...

[Murph, who is sitting beside Paul Briganti, laughs uproariously.]

PAUL: ...Why are you mean to me?

AMIR: What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?

SAM: Uh, excuse me: "movie"? It's supposed to be a short web clip.

AMIR: Started off as that. But the more we worked on it, the more this bird wanted to be a plump, plump princess, a tubby fowl.

JAKE: It's off to, you know, a little bit of a rough start, but I think with some patience, Sam, I really think we can... we can find our voice.

AMIR: [yelling] It has full frontal!... It has full backal!

JAKE: It's quirky. That's true. But I believe we can find some dedicated weirdos to laugh along with us.

AMIR: [yelling] I'm a dumbass! I'm a dumbass extraordinaire, and I was in charge of making it, and then I, I did it!

JAKE: Okay. I play Jake, uh, everyday straight man...

[Amir waves.]

JAKE: ...opposite my annoying co-worker, Amir.

AMIR: [yelling] I play me: Jake!

JAKE: You play Amir.

AMIR: [yelling] Henry!

JAKE: [to Amir] You're getting overly excited. [to the audience] Alright, Amir plays an over-the-top--

AMIR: [yelling and shaking] --demented dumbass Jew with a black heart and a raisin toe dick, who gets off to making Jake proud and nothing else!

JAKE: Calm down, please.

AMIR: [yelling, shaking] I am calm!

JAKE: You're shaking.

AMIR: [yelling, shaking] I love being in front of people! I'm famous today! [stomps]

SAM: [to himself] What have I done...

JAKE: We've taken up enough of your time. We'll just let you guys enjoy the movie.

[Jake walks off-stage, dragging along Amir, who is still vibrating with energy.]

AMIR: [still yelling] Yeah! In the beginning is when I cut my dick off in it!



[As the movie plays, Jake and Amir stay backstage. Jake is waiting nervously, but Amir has begun doing his celebratory dance.]

AMIR: Henry!... Henry!...

JAKE: Can you please stop celebrating? We don't even know how it's going in there.

AMIR: I'm sure it's doing great!

[Sam enters the backstage area.]

SAM: Alright guys! You are fired.

JAKE: Of course.

AMIR: [simultaneously] Why?

SAM: I just saw you amputate your penis... asshole!

JAKE: [to Amir] Why did you leave that in?

AMIR: It's art!

SAM: What the fuck is "backal"?

[In the theater, the audience can be heard groaning loudly in disgust.]

AMIR: Probably just missed it!

[Pat runs into the backstage area and bee-lines for the trash can to vomit. The lid only opens once he has finished throwing up, splattering his vomit on the back wall.]

PAT: I can never unsee that.

[Pat walks away, staring daggers at Jake and Amir as he leaves.]

AMIR: It is memorable. Agreed.

SAM: Yeah, you guys are done at CollegeHumor. I might be done at CollegeHumor! I now have to distance myself from the two of you.

[Sam walks away, only turning back to scream a few thoughts at them.]

SAM: "Backal"?... Assholes! ...Fuck! ...My parents died in a plane crash!...



[Jake and Amir have returned to the CollegeHumor building alone. They sit in the silent office, packing up their desks. Amir picks up a pen, tries to twirl it between his fingers, and fails.]

AMIR: ...Hey, do you know any pen tricks?

JAKE: Focus on being sad. Alright? Let the feeling of failure wash over you.

[Amir makes a defensive face to dismiss Jake. Eventually, though, he leans back meditatively in his chair and takes a deep breath, taking in the situation. He nods sadly.]

AMIR: ...You jumped the carp tonight, man.

JAKE: Excuse me?

AMIR: Didn't want to say anything, [swinging the pen like a small baseball bat] but you came out swinging and whiffing! [laughs] I think we should have stuck to the original script, the original plan.

JAKE: That's what I'm saying. [picking up the original script, tossing a copy to Amir] Look at this thing! It was so easy to produce, we could have shot it ourselves on one of these.

[Jake holds up a small digital camera. He hands it to Amir, who studies it.]

AMIR: ...Huh.

JAKE: Come on. What's your first line?

[Amir clears his throat, holds the camera at arm's length to his side, and begins recording. The video they record is the 2007 Jake and Amir episode "Beer". During their read we see glimpses of Amir's recorded footage, which is that of the original episode.]

AMIR: "So drunk..."

JAKE: Uh-- "You're drunk right now?"

AMIR: "Last night, I got so drunk..."

JAKE: "Um... you-- ...nice."

AMIR: "I had, like, so many beers."

JAKE: "How many? How many is so many?"

AMIR: "I was, like, retarded."

JAKE: "How many beers did you have?"

AMIR "...Sixty."

JAKE: "Sixty? That's... sixty is way too many. That's not a believable number at all."

AMIR: "I know... how many is believable?"

JAKE: "Twelve?"

AMIR: "I know. Twelve. I had twelve beers. I was... stupid afterwards."

JAKE: "I don't think you even know-- I don't think you've had any beer, ever."

[Amir pauses, losing motivation to continue reading.]

JAKE: ...Actually, this is pretty bad.

AMIR: It was funny when we wrote it.

JAKE: Yeah, I guess so...

[They both put their copies of the script in their boxes. Amir sighs.]

JAKE: ...So what's next?

[Amir pauses for a long time as he tries to think of an answer.]

AMIR: ...Dinner tonight?

[Jake quietly contemplates Amir's offer, and takes a last look around the offices of CollegeHumor. The screen cuts to black.]
