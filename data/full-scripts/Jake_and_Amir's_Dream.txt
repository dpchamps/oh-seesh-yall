INTRO
(A paper reads "COLLEGEHUMOR'S â?? ALL-NIGHTER â??"; "TEN VIDEOS. ONE NIGHT.")
ALL: CollegeHumor's All-Nighter!
[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir is beginning to nod off, and shakes his head to keep awake.]
AMIR: Ugh... I don't know if I can make it, man. [scoffs] Like, the finish line is in sight... but I'm not right. [laughs] What time is it? Four AM? Five AM? 4:05 AM?
JAKE: 7:45 PM, the All-Nighter starts in another fifteen minutes, and it goes for twelve hours.
AMIR: Stop hounding my shit, please, okay? I'm pissed, I'm scared, I'm tired, I'm... there...
JAKE: What? Where?
AMIR: There.
JAKE: How are you this tired already?
AMIR: [laughs] I'm glad you asked.
[Amir falls asleep immediately.]
JAKE: Dude, wake up!
[There is an ethereal transition accompanied by a harp sound. Jake and Amir are now both female, and appear to be Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer from Broad City. Amir wakes up.]
ILANA-AMIR: Holy guac! That nap was more than legit: it was dec'!
ABBI-JAKE: I think that might make it less than legit.
ILANA-AMIR: Don't nitpick my twitpic, ya shit-dick! Now that wit was quite quick.
ABBI-JAKE: Do you want me to get you some coffee? Maybe that would wake you up?
ILANA-AMIR: I'm clearly awake if I'm talking to you, Scooby-frickin'-Don't.
ABBI-JAKE: What are you even talking about?
ILANA-AMIR: Bad Scooby? Nah. Bad Doo.
[Ilana-Amir begins laughing and then falls asleep.]
[Another transition and harp sound later, Amir and Jake are Brian McElhaney and Nick Kocher from BriTANick.]
BRIAN-AMIR: [still laughing] Dude, you gotta crack up at that shit! That Scooby-Doo pun? That destroyed at my pop-pop's wake.
NICK-JAKE: Why did you tell it there?
BRIAN-AMIR: Um, 'cause everyone was sad? Especially me! I was his closest friend! Open casket? Now I can't buy a basket.
NICK-JAKE: Can you please try not to rhyme all of the time?
BRIAN-AMIR: You just did it!
NICK-JAKE: That was unintentional.
BRIAN-AMIR: Oh, an unintentional rhyme? Well I'm an unconventional mime, [he moves his hands as if in an invisible box] eating an unpresentable lime.
[Brian-Amir pantomimes taking a bite out of an invisible lime.]
BRIAN-AMIR: Eww!-- Fuck you. Crack up at that.
NICK-JAKE: Wh-- you didn't even give me time to laugh at that! You knew that would fail.
BRIAN-AMIR: Fuck you, fuck you, I'm cool, and fuck you.
[Brian-Amir begins laughing.]
BRIAN-AMIR: Ohh! Oh, it hurts to laugh, it hurts to laugh...
[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are Andrew and Evan Gregory of the Gregory Brothers.]
EVAN-AMIR: ...And fuck you.
ANDREW-JAKE: I-- I think we should ask Sam if you can go home.
EVAN-AMIR: Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?
ANDREW-JAKE: Yes, I would.
EVAN-AMIR: Wow. The truth comes tumbling out. Jake's a frickin' anti-Semite. And that just ain't right.
ANDREW-JAKE: ...What?
[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are themselves; Amir seems to be talking in his sleep.]
AMIR: I said "You, Jacob Hurwitz... you're an anti-Semite."
[Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew and Evan have gathered around Jake's chair.]
NICK: What did he just say?
JAKE: He's half-asleep, dude. What do you mean "what did he just say"? It doesn't matter.
ABBI: Oh, it doesn't matter because what? What, because he's a Jew?
[Abbi shoves Jake.]
JAKE: I didn't say that! What are you talking about?
AMIR: [now very much awake] I'm talkin' about you hating Jew.
ILANA: You prick! I know many Jews.
JAKE: So do I! I'm half Jewish--
[Brian punches Jake in the face.]
JAKE: Ow!
BRIAN: I don't hit like a Jew, do I?
JAKE: ...That was anti-Semitic, what you just said!
AMIR: Get him!
JAKE: What are you talking about--
[Everybody begins beating up Jake.]
JAKE: Hey! Ow! Ow, quit it--
[Amir laughs maniacally.]
[Harp and transition. Amir is lying on a couch, presumably dreaming the situation just shown. He is laughing in his sleep. Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew, Evan and Jake are standing around him.]
ANDREW: I thought you said we were gonna shoot a video.
JAKE: I'm sorry; I think he fell asleep, so...
AMIR: [mumbling] Tear his... Jew-hating face off.
