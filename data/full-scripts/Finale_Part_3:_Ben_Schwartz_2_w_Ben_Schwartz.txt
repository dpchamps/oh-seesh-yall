INTRO

BEN: Are you a Jake, or an Amir? Find out soon on Jerk and Abeesh!



[The episode begins at the end of the previous one, with Ben Schwartz bringing Jake and Amir into his house.]

BEN: These are my roommates.

[We see that Ben has many roommates that look exactly like him, accounting for all of what were assumed to be his previous appearances. The doctor and the priest are sitting at the table, and Scalbylausus Jim the H.R. guy, Sulu Candles the usher, and Charles Crooshtoost the milkman are in the kitchen. Amir Blumenfeld the dating coach scoots by on an office chair.]

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman!

[In the living room, the office painter, Cherry Dude the real estate agent, and the couples therapist are sitting on the couch. Jope the private eye is crouching behind them.]

CHERRY DUDE: Heyyy!

[Jake shakes his head in disbelief.]

AMIR BLUMENFELD (DATING COACH): Hey, how are ya. Amir Blumenfeld.

AMIR: But--

AMIR BLUMENFELD (DATING COACH): But everybody's name is Amir Blumenfeld. [to Jake] What's your name?

JAKE: Jake Hurwitz.

AMIR BLUMENFELD (DATING COACH): [scoffs] The exception to the rule. [to Amir] Your name?

AMIR: Amir Blumenfeld!

[Ben gestures at Amir excitedly.]

AMIR BLUMENFELD (DATING COACH): Uhh, ah-thank-ahhh.

JAKE: I don't understand... you're Amir's old dating coach. [to the couples therapist] You're our couples therapist.

[The couples therapist begins doing his shrill seal laugh.]

JOPE: I told you, no more of that!

[Jope chloroforms the couples therapist.]

AMIR: Jope!

JAKE: How is this possible?

[The office painter says something, but the cigarette in his mouth makes it unintelligible. Jope puts the couples therapist's hand in his pants while he's out.]

JAKE: What?

[The office painter repeats himself.]

JAKE: Excuse me?

OFFICE PAINTER: [spitting out his cigarette] Art imitating life, Jake.

JAKE [to Ben, who looks like he is judging Jake] Don't do that. That's the first time he said it that way.

BEN: He said "art imitates life, Jake" three times!

AMIR: He did, yeah.

JAKE: Alright.

SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Oh, what's my name?

JAKE: Nobody asked you that.

SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: My name is...

JAKE: Jim?

SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Scal... bylausus... Jim.

JAKE: Why do you introduce yourself like you're just figuring out your name for the first time?

SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: I know my name! ...Oh, my name?

[Stanley, who is on the stairs, throws a net at Jake.]

STANLEY: Hold back, hold back, hold back! Moo... moo!

JAKE: I'm not a fucking cow, man.

STANLEY: You mean "Don't have a cow, man."

JAKE: I think you actually think that I'm a cow.

STANLEY: This is exactly what a fucking cow would say, to try to weasel and snake his way out of a confrontation--

JAKE: Okay, do you hear yourself? You're saying it sounds like something a cow would say, to weasel and sn-- [to Ben] your roommate's insane.

STANLEY: You stupid fucking cow.

BEN: Stanley, you know what? I'm pretty sure he's not a cow, but he is a dick.

[Carrot Slat comes through the door from another room.]

CARROT SLAT: How are you guys, huh? You ever figure out who shit in that copier?

JAKE: Oh, no.

BEN: Oh, yes. You've been a dick the entire day, Jake. Yes.

JAKE: No, no, I mean "oh no, it's Carrot".

AMIR: Carrot who?

JAKE: It's Carrot Slat!

AMIR: He tried to blow you!

JAKE: He tr-- wha--? He did blow me!

BEN: Okay.

JAKE: That's enough. I want the language to change, right now, that he did...

BEN: He is harmless, he is harmless.

[As Jake and Ben argue, Carrot Slat is pulled back through the door. Stepping out in his place is the interrogator from Interrogator Part 2, who was apparently a different person the whole time.]

INTERROGATOR: I shit in the copier.

JAKE: No. No, no no no, no, no--

[The interrogator punches Jake twice in the face and starts grabbing at Jake's belt.]

JAKE: Ow, oh! Oh-- g--

[Jake shoves him off, and the interrogator waddles away, spinning.]

JAKE: Get out of here!

STANLEY: [to the interrogator] You get that dirty fucking cow!

[The interrogator comes back, fists raised, punches Jake again and goes for the belt.]

STANLEY: Grade A beef!

INTERROGATOR: [suddenly stepping back] Get off of me!

JAKE: Don't blow me, man!

BEN: Why would he blow you, Jake?

JAKE: He's done it before, okay? He really has.

BEN: Tried to.

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman! Looks like you got a shiner there. You want something cold to put on it?

JAKE: Yes, please.

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Ah, well the name is Charles Crooshtoost, and I bring milk to man! What year could I get you, son?

JAKE: Anything that's cold.

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: In my hand right now, I've got a vintage September 1242.

JAKE: No, that sounds like it's way too old.

BEN: Well...

JAKE: It's antique milk.

BEN: Who knows?

[Amir shrugs.]

JAKE: It's poison.

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Where's the shiner?

JAKE: It's right here.

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman!

JAKE: Yes, thank you, thank you--

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST [pouring chunky milk all over Jake's head] Here we go, and now we're feeling good in the hood! We're feeling good in the hood.

JAKE: What the fuck are you--

STANLEY: You're wasting all that cow juice!

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Way to go, gotta go!

JAKE: ...Why did you do that?

DOCTOR: Guys, I am a doctor. Everybody calm down. You shouldn't be pouring old milky cottage cheese on your face. Take the cold glass, and put it against your face!

JAKE: Yeah, I know.

AMIR: You should have listened to the doctor, Jake.

JAKE: Don't.

SULU CANDLES: [singing and dancing] I hear we're writing a movie, I hear we're writing a movie! I hear we're writing a movie... but first, let's eat a snack!

[Sulu Candles throws a bag of candy at Jake, and it hits him in the face.]

STANLEY: You could have caught it if you had fingers, cow!

JAKE: This is the worst day of my life.

BEN: Ugh... what about the day you got your dick sucked?

JAKE: ...That was up there too.

BEN: Right.

AMIR: The attempted dick-sucking.

JAKE: Attem-- it happened.

BEN: Sure.

JAKE: Get that through your head.

BEN: Sure.

SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Oh, what's my name?

AMIR: Geez, how many people live here? How'd you find this place?

BEN: Actually, Cherry Dude found it for us, and he moved in.

CHERRY DUDE: It was either this or a cupcake in La Cienega that'll drive ya wild!

AMIR: I'd be down to live in a cupcake.

JAKE: You already live in a muffin, [to Cherry Dude] thanks to you.

CHERRY DUDE: Movin' on!

BEN: Everybody, listen up: Jake and Amir are here because they want to write a web series, and they need a little help with the first episode.

JOPE: Ooh, I'll DJ the premiere party. What about this... [singing] Hey, yo, my name is Drake... do you know my buddy Samuel... he's got a Razor scooter... go, Samuel, you're doing it!

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: And I will bring the milk!

JAKE: Nobody drinks milk at parties.

[As Charles Crooshtoost is talking, Sulu Candles tries to make Jake flinch with the bag of candy.]

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Okay, how old are the kids going to your parties? "Nobody drinks milk at parties"!

JAKE: Do you party with children?

BEN: Jake, why are you taking the wind out of everybody's sails? [to Amir] Is he always like this?

JAKE: [gesturing to Charles Crooshtoost] He's a pedophile.

AMIR: He's-- he's literally always negative to me, and he's always bringing me down.

BEN: Oh my God. You know what? You have to start saying "yes, and" to things. That's how comedy works. You build upon things.

[The interrogator returns.]

INTERROGATOR: That's right, you piece of shit. So stop saying no and start saying yes! [lunges at Jake's pants]

JAKE: Get out of here! Hey-- Ow! Get off of me, man!

INTERROGATOR: Fine! It may be illegal now, but it won't be for long!

JAKE: It's always gonna be against the law to do that.

INTERROGATOR: [leaving] Oh, we'll see. My dad's in the Senate.

JAKE: Alright, look, stop it. You guys can all help. Just one idea at a time, and no blowing me.

BEN: Oh.

AMIR: Or...

BEN: Or?

AMIR: ...everyone pitch their ideas at the same time and we get out of here fifty times quicker.

BEN: So smart. Let's do that. I'll get my laptop. Let's go over here.

JAKE: Not smart. It's actually a dumb idea.

[Amir follows Ben and makes a two-person conga line.]

BEN: [sitting down at his laptop] Everybody, on your marks, get set, go!

[All of Ben's roommates begin talking over each other. Most of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony.]

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Fade up, on Charles Crooshtoost...

SULU CANDLES: Open on a movie theater...

CHERRY DUDE: ...in Wilshire. There he is...

JOPE: ...What are they doing? They're trying to...

CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: [singing] ...Hail to the milkman, the milkman, the milkman! Hail to the milkman, the milkman is me!...

SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: ...never been stretched before. What are these called? Elbows...

SULU CANDLES: ...all the snacks to themselves! What am I gonna do? How am I gonna do it?...

STANLEY: ...and strikes the defender! "Whoa, cow," he says, "whoa!"

SULU CANDLES: ...What are we gonna do?...

[Ben and Amir both type on the computer, and Amir laughs maniacally at what they're writing.]



[A title card reads "4 Hours Later". Jake has toweled the milk off his face.]

BEN: Done! ...Perfect, we did it!

JAKE: No it's not. I didn't get a word in edgewise, guys. How many pages is this thing?

BEN: Yeah-- it is... four hundred and two pages, but, to be fair, it is double-sided.

JAKE: That is 804, then.

BEN: Yeah, but you know what? I just double-checked it: it's way over a thousand.

AMIR: That's okay. It's better to have over a thousand pages of garbage than four pages of gold.

BEN: Yeah.

JAKE: Completely disagree.

BEN: Hey, what do you guys say about a wrap party, huh?

[Ben hits a key, and Stony's remix "The Milkman" begins playing. Scalbylausus Jim and Sulu Candles start dancing, and Charles Crooshtoost mouths along to the words.]

JAKE: [as Ben and Amir dance] How is this possible? These are sound clips from our actual lives.



[A montage begins, set to "The Milkman", featuring outtakes from all of the episodes in which Ben Schwartz appeared.]

[Jake, Amir, and Ben share a moment out of character.]

JAKE: Hey Ben.

BEN: Yeah?

JAKE: Thank you.

BEN: No, thank you, man.

AMIR: You've been great.

BEN: This has been so much fun.

[Amir and Ben hug. Ben goes to Jake for a hug, but dips down toward Jake's crotch at the last second.]

JAKE: No, no!

BEN: Yeah, yeah, of course.
