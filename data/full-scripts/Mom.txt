Amir: Mom, you are not coming up here. You do not come up here. That is so un-ace of you.

Amir: Of course you wouldn't get what that means. It's an inside joke between me and my bestest friend in the world. 

Amir: Listen, if you come up here, you're going to embarrass me, you're gonna embarrass me more than you've ever embarrassed me before. 

Amir: Just leave the cake with the security guard downstairs and I'll get it on my way home. Bye.

Jake: What was that?

Amir: Lunch? What are you thinking for lunch?

Jake: Was that your mom? You talk like that to your mother?

Amir: You don't get it, man. She's embarrassing as hell. 

Jake: Why? What is she doing?

Amir: First of all, she came here. She came here with a cake. She wants to come upstairs, meet everybody, give cake to everyone like it's a frickin' kindergarten class.

Jake: That's awesome! Cake... everybody here likes cake. Why would that be embarrassing? 

Amir: You don't get it. That's...

Jake: I brought my mom up here like two weeks ago.

Amir: Honestly, and I wasn't going to say anything, just-

Jake (interrupting): Don't say it.

Amir: Ok. You just, you look like a gaylord.

Jake: Don't be a dick, alright?

Amir: Ok. Classic example. Freshman year, she sends me cookies in the mail because it's was my birthday, right? I couldn't throw them away, I had to flush them down the toilet because I was afraid everybody would see them.

Jake: What's wrong with that?

Amir: Ugh, hold on a second. What? Oh my god, I don't need a laptop, I already told you. Just give it to the maid, I honestly... Goodbye.

Jake: What the hell is wrong with you?

Amir: It's like... do you have anyone in your life that just pisses you off, annoys you so much you wish you could just tell them off?

Jake: Yes.

Amir: But you secretly love them?

Jake: No.
