AMIR: (sighs) A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

JAKE: What? What are you taking about?

AMIR: Just a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It's one of those days.

JAKE: What are you referring to?

AMIR: I'm not referring to anything, it's just like a.. it's like a proverb. You just say it when there's silence in the room just to say something.

JAKE: That's not how those work. They all mean something.

AMIR: They don't--none of them mean anything, you just say them, like Don't count your chickens before they hatch! or something.

JAKE: No, that means something. That means not to like expect too much of anything.

AMIR: Yeah, that one means--that one probably means something but like all these other ones don't like mean anything, like Keep your nose to the grindstone! or whatever.

JAKE: That means like to work hard.

AMIR: Well you come up with one that doesn't mean anything then!

JAKE: I couldn't. They all mean something.

AMIR: Not all of them. Not all of them.

JAKE: (nods) Yeah.

AMIR: Let me explain it to you. I don't think I'm explaining it right. If I'm sitting here in silence and you're also sitting there, I'll just be like Don't get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning! and then you'll be like (tips cap) whatever you tip your cap or whatever.

JAKE: Do you honestly think that's how proverbs work?

AMIR: Pssshhh.

JAKE: Forget it. I'm just gonna ignore you the rest of the day.

AMIR: Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

JAKE: Alright. You're right. See? Makes sense.

AMIR: That doesn't mean anything. 

JAKE: Nevermind.
