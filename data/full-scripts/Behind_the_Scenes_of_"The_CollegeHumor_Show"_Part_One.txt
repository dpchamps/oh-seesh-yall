(Amir and Jake are on either side on Sam)

AMIR: We are here with Sam Reich, who is not only a writer and an actor on the show, heâ€™s also a producer--

SAM: (talking to someone off camera) Move the sign. 

AMIR: H-h-hey, come on now. Heâ€™s a producer--

SAM: Itâ€™s too high.

AMIR: --and heâ€™s a director. 

JAKE: Wow. 

AMIR: One second, weâ€™re interviewing you, all right?

JAKE: Quadruple threat, boys.

AMIR: (chuckles) A triple threat. 

JAKE: Quadruple. 

AMIR: Threat. 



(in Rickyâ€™s office)

JAKE: All right, weâ€™re here with Ricky Van Veen, our boss and the creator of CollegeHumor. Weâ€™re days away from our premiere, (to Ricky) how do you feel?

RICKY: Itâ€™s exciting! Weâ€™re doing a lot of promos, trying to get people to watch. 

AMIR: Iâ€™m going to give you fifty bucks, you give me carte blanche, all access pass to your e-mail. You leave the office, I need inbox, outbox, drafts, trash, what do you say?

RICKY: No. 



JAKE: All right, Phantom, what do you prefer, writing or acting?

PHANTOM: I mean, thatâ€™s like asking me if I like elkâ€™s blood or plum wine more. 

AMIR: Plum wine? 

PHANTOM: Yeah, I mean theyâ€™re both great in their own way. 



(back in Rickyâ€™s office)

AMIR: OK, eighty dollars to use your iPhone for two minutes. 

JAKE: Come on!

AMIR: Iâ€™m already picking up the iPhone.

RICKY: No. Put down my iPhone. 

AMIR: Give me eighty bucks. 

RICKY: Seriously. 

AMIR: Real quick, I have to call my mom!



(just Ricky and Jake)

RICKY: Itâ€™s like every time that I think heâ€™s going to change, every time I think itâ€™s going to be different-itâ€™s not! 

JAKE: You think it doesnâ€™t bother me? 



(back with Sam)

AMIR: Whoa, Sammy. 

JAKE: How much do we have left to shoot, Sam? 

SAM: We have one week left of shooting. 

AMIR: Wow, one week! Sounds super stressful. Plus we have my rap battle scene. 

SAM: Thereâ€™s no rap battle scene. 

AMIR: Whatâ€™s that? 

SAM: Thereâ€™s no rap battle scene. 



(Amir and Jake are on either side of Dan)

JAKE: Weâ€™re here with Dan Gurewitch, a writer and actor on the show. 

AMIR: Yup. Dan, who do you play on the CollegeHumor show? 

DAN: Uh, Dan.

AMIR: Tell us a little bit about your character. 

DAN: Uh, itâ€™s kind of like, all our characters, itâ€™s just like us, but more exaggerated, sort of dumber, more self-centered versions of ourselves. 

AMIR: Well, Sam told me that my character was just me, like Iâ€™m not supposed to exaggerate,  itâ€™s just uh, who I am. (chuckles) Or whatever. 

DAN: Oh. Uh, thatâ€™s--



(back to Phantom)

PHANTOM: Now hereâ€™s the thing about MTV. Itâ€™s like called what, music television, when was the last time they played a video? 

AMIR: Yeah. 

PHANTOM: For real. Theyâ€™ll play fifteen seconds of a video at the end of The Hills--

JAKE: Talk to us. 

PHANTOM: --and then--



(back to Sam, Vinny is there)

VINNY: Uh, sorry, but we really have to go. 

SAM: I know!

(they all start talking over each other) 

AMIR: W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wait, I know--

VINNY: We really have to--(Amir pushes Vinny out of frame)

AMIR: weâ€™re also losing light.

SAM: Iâ€™d like to, what Iâ€™ve was saying was--

AMIR: (to Sam) Ah, we donâ€™t need light!

JAKE: Hey, itâ€™s fine. Weâ€™re here with Sam Reich, actor-

(Vinny re-enters shot)

VINNY: Itâ€™s his job to make sure that--

JAKE: --director, producer--

SAM: Shut the f**k up--

JAKE: --writer--

SAM: --seriously, guys. Seriously. 

AMIR: OK.

SAM: I mean, itâ€™s funny, but weâ€™re losing daylight and weâ€™re trying to make an actual show. 

AMIR: I know. 

(Jake puts down his mic and walks off)

AMIR: I kn--I know. 

SAM: This is in actual show that needs to go on actual television. 

AMIR: Shhhhh... 

Vinny: (off camera) Iâ€™m really sorry. 

(Jake is also off camera, pulls Amir off)

AMIR: Uh, weâ€™ll be right back!

JAKE: No!
