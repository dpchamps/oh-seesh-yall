Episode-
Amir:  Ah, am I ready for summer?  Yeah, I think so.
Jake:  What are you doing?
Amir:  I knew you'd be jealous that I have forty-eight hot summer fashion tips and you have precisely zero.
Jake:  Is the first tip dressing like a schizophrenic homosexual?
Amir:  No, the first tip is white sunglasses.
Jake:  And you memorized them all...
Amir:  Yez
Jake:  What's tip number forty-two?
Amir:  Lace underwear, lightweight, sexy
Jake:  And how does it feel?
Amir:  Lightweight, sexy, really uncomfortable.
Jake:  Tip number eight?
Amir:  Nail polish!
Jake:  I'm impressed that you know all this, but I wish you wouldn't use the little brain power that you have to memorize girls magazines.
Amir:  If they were really girls magazines, would I know fifteen ways to freak HIM out in bed?
Jake:  You wanna freak guys out in bed?
Amir:  Yah, I like scaring people, and now I can do that, in bed.
Jake:  Scaring people like boo?
Amir:  No, scaring people like licking their toes.  Okay, really freaking them out.
Jake: I think this is the most you have ever not gotten it.  And that's saying a lot.
Amir:  I don't know why you're being angry Mr. Leo.  Today is your diva day.  You should act the part at a party.
Jake:  I'm just gonna... I'm gonna ignore you, sorry
(Amir is not in his chair)
Jake:  Jesus, what are you doing!?
(Amir comes up from under jake's desk)
Amir: Freaking you out, sorry for trying!
