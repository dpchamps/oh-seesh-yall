[Introduction] 

Jake: Hey, you're watching Jake  Amir. 

Amir: Hey, starting when? 

Jake: Now. 

Amir: So say that! 

[Jake is sitting on the toilet, playing Angry Birds] 

Jake: Take that, pig f***er. 

Amir (knocking on the stall door): Hey! 

Jake: Someone's in here. 

Amir: Jake! Jake! 

Jake: Yeah, I'm in here. 

Amir: Where are you? 

Jake: In the- Where are you? Right? You're in the bathroom. So, where am I? In the bathroom. 

Amir: Okay, you just left your desk two minutes ago and you didn't say anything. 

Jake: I said I'd be right back! 

Amir: sighs What does that mean? 

Jake: It means I'll be right back and not to follow me to the bathroom. 

Amir: Okay, should I chill out here, or you want me to wait for you? 

Jake: Just chi- Okay, I see what you did. Neither. Alright? Just go away. 

Amir: Hey! Let me in, okay? Somebody's coming. 

Jake: No. 

(Amir scoffs. coworker enters the bathroom) 

Amir (in a Boston accent): Hey! Get outta here! Nobody's takin' a poop here! Mind your own bees! 

(Coworker leaves) 

Jake: Hey, whoever that is, don't worry, you can go to the bathroom. It's fine. 

Amir: He already left. 

Jake: Come on man. We have to work here, right? 

Amir: How much longer do you have in there? 

Jake: I don't know, alright? I can't exactly go to the bathroom with you here talking to me. 

Amir: Fine, fine. I'll stay, but I won't say anything. 

Jake: That makes no sense, but fine. 

(Brief silence broken by Amir making a high pitched noise.)

Amir: Hey, I read on Yahoo News that laptops are cooking people's- 

Jake (interrupting Amir): Hey man, you just said you weren't gonna say anything. 

Amir: Alright, fine, okay? Keep it mum, alright? Mum's the word. 

Jake: Thank you. 

Amir (To the tune of War by Edwin Starr): Mum! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing! 

(Amir kicks in the stall door and falls to the floor) 

Jake: Jesus Christ, man! What is wrong with you? 

Amir: Me? You said no talking! That was a kick! 

Jake: Yeah, you were singing! 

Amir: Oh my god! Singing isn't talking. 

Jake: Yes it is! 

Amir: Why do I- Why do I bother? Why do I bother if you're just not gonna like it? 

[After College Humor logo, Amir is still on he floor in front of the stall.]

Amir: It just doesn't- I don't buy it man. I'm sorry, it doesn't make sense. Why would I- Why would I do this? Like, it doesn't- It doesn't help. You don't like me. It just drives you away even more, and then mumble in the bathroom? That's so- it's cold, man. This is a waste of time.
