Amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I just ate a sock.

Jake: Why'd you do that?

Amir: I—(gags) I don't know...



Amir: (eating sandwich) You know, new office: not so bad!

Jake: Nope.

Amir: Free sandwiches in the fridge are pretty chill.

Jake: Yeah, those aren't free; those are people's lunches.

Amir: Well, free for the taking.

Jake: So you're aware you're stealing them?

Amir: ...Fat-free.

Jake: Okay, I should probably get back to work.

Amir: Yeah, well, you already are at work, okay? You dumbfuck.

Jake: Hey, hey, hey! New office, right? We probably shouldn't be yelling stuff like that out loud.

Amir: Well, you wanna yell as much as you want?

Jake: No.

Amir: Well, I was gonna say if you did, you should probably come visit my side of the office for once, okay? 

Jake: Okay, well, I said I didn't want to do that so it's not an issue.

Murph: Uh, hey, man... Um, back from the bathroom, so...

Amir: Yeah... Uh... Oh, please, sir! Give me five more minutes! I do declare! (laughs) Please give me five more minutes with Jake. Thank you.

Murph: Uh, yeah, m—It—It has been five minutes; it's been, like, fifteen minutes actually. Uh, I should probably get back to work.

Amir: Yeah... Okay, fine. (to Jake, talking low) Hey, there's no way in hell you like working with this guy more than you like working next to me.

Jake: Definitely hear you... He's—You're closer to him than you are to me.

Amir: (walks away, talking loudly) Okay! Then I'm off to my side of the office where everybody has fun! And all the cool people are! (goes back to desk, looking around, then snaps) All right, everybody! Listen up: five-minute work break, starting... a-now! Get up! (claps) Get—Hey! That's an order! Get up! Stand up! Stand on your ch—No, you know what! (leaps on desk) STAND ON YOUR DESK! HUH? Let's have fun for once! (laughs) Come on! (claps to rhythm) Hey! Hey! Come on! All right, this is an old-fashioned Blumenfeld family fuckfest! Let's do this! Hey, don't be shy! I want everybody! (pointing) You, you! (points to Amanda) Okay, we got one brave soul right here! (climbs over desk as Amanda gets up to leave) Comin' up! One time! Now we're havin' fun! (embraces Amanda, then pushed away forcefully) Okay. (awkwardly shuffles back to desk) Does anyone have the wireless? ...Password? (silence) ...Got it.
