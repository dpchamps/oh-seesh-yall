INTRO

EMILY: Hey, you're watching Murph and Emily!

JAKE: No they're not.

MURPH: Yes they are!

AMIR: Aaaaaaah, he's hurting my back!



[The episode begins with the end of the previous one.]

JAKE: I-- I mean, this night has been... insane!

MURPH: It's-- It's been crazy...

JAKE: Right?

MURPH: It's nuts.

JAKE: I think we're gonna be better friends for it, though. I really do.

[Jake and Murph shake. Suddenly, Murph slips his arm under Jake's center of gravity, hoists him up onto his shoulders, and moves toward the edge of the balcony.]

JAKE: Whoa, dude! No! No. No! Stop it!

[Jake pushes against the rail to hold himself back, and Murph drops him back onto the balcony.]

JAKE: ...What the fuck was that?

MURPH: I browned out!

JAKE: That was illegal!

MURPH: I browned out, man!

JAKE: That was illegal, man!

MURPH: I was following my heart!

JAKE: What do you mean, following your heart?

MURPH: I'm so-- I d--

JAKE: You tried to kill me!

MURPH: Okay--

JAKE: If I didn't wiggle out of that, man, I'd be dead right now.

MURPH: Okay, that was wack of me.

JAKE: Wack? What're you talkin' about, wack?

MURPH: Okay, it was-- it was--

JAKE: Murder.

MURPH: It was eight stories. Eight stories.

JAKE: Exactly! That's death-height! That's a death, dude!

AMIR: Pussy.

JAKE: ...What?

[Amir is also standing on the balcony, smoking a joint.]

AMIR: I said: You're a pussy.

JAKE: You've been standing there the entire time? Why didn't you try to stop him?

AMIR: I'm smoking a J.

[Jake breaks down into tears.]

JAKE: [sobbing] Dude... Man, he tried to kill me...

MURPH: [also crying] I didn't mean to!

JAKE: [crying] What're you talkin' about, you didn't mean to?

AMIR: [crying] If you guys start crying, then I'm gonna frickin' cry, too; I'm gonna beef...

MURPH: [crying] You kissed-- you kissed my girlfriend...

JAKE: [crying] I kissed her, man... but I was drunk on the grig'...

MURPH: [crying] It was the grig', man, it was the grig'..

AMIR: [crying] You had a lotta grig'...

JAKE: [crying] Aw, too much grig'...

AMIR: [crying] It was some primo grig'; it was a '95 Ritratti...

MURPH: [crying] It was a friggin' Ritratti, yeah, it was a Ritratti...

JAKE: [sobbing] Ritratti...

AMIR: [crying] Yeah... yeah, it was a Ritratti, it's an aphrodisiac...

[Suddenly all the crying stops.]

MURPH: Jake, you gotta propose to Neko.

JAKE: ...What?

MURPH: I need you out of the game, man. You need to Jake one for the team.

AMIR: You do, man. Bros propose before hos; I've always said that.

JAKE: Look, you guys: I'm out of the game, okay? Trust me.

MURPH: Look, man, it's my way or the balcon-ay!

JAKE: Okay, hey-- Hey. Okay, I'll do it. I'll propose to Neko... It's not like she's gonna say yes.

[Cut to Neko, hearing Jake's proposal.]

NEKO: Yes!

JAKE: ...What?

NEKO: [ecstatic] Yes!

JAKE: ...No!

[Neko and Emily jump up and down excitedly, and hug each other.]

EMILY: Oh my God oh my God oh my God! Oh, I'm so happy for you!

JAKE: Emily, you're okay with this?

MURPH: Are you okay... with this?

[Murph presents a ring to Emily.]

EMILY: Oh my God...

JAKE: How many rings do you have?

MURPH: Emily Wayne Dolphin... I want to-- luh-luh-luh-lick you-- for the rest of my life.

JAKE: Bad.

EMILY: You better, you piece of shit!

[Emily runs into Murph's arms.]

EMILY: Yes!

JAKE: What is happening? How is this real?

AMIR: Double wedding!

[Amir uncorks a bottle. The cork hits Jake in the eye.]

JAKE: Ow-- Ow, my eye... I'm blind, man! I'm blind and I'm engaged!

NEKO: That's my fiance, you clumsy bitch!

AMIR: Yeah, well you haven't eaten shit all night, so bring it!

[Neko puts Amir in a headlock and holds him to the railing.]

AMIR: Okay. Okay, I'm high! I'm high! Let go of me, I'm high! Jake, I'm stoned!



[Jake and Neko spend a romantic night under the fireworks, making out and both texting on one phone.]
