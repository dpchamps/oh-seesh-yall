AMIR : Ugh this is the worst day ever! I have a recital tonight and my vibrato is still weak as shit. It's just this whole embarrassing thing.   

JAKE : Where did you learn any of this?   

AMIR: Okay. Now you're gonna make a huge deal out of this because yes I studied at The Avasino Conservatory for Performing Arts in Italy...
