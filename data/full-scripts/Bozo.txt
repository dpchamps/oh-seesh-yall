Amir: INCOMING!

Jake:(laughing) What are you doing, bozo?

Amir: You're the bozo, bozo!

Jake: Oh bozo? You're a dweeb.

Amir: Don't touch me it hurts my shoulder

Jake: Hey, have you been to the kitchen today?

Amir: Oh, uh no, I have not.

Jake: Oh, well you should go in and check out the fridge.

Amir: Oh, no thank you, I'm not hungry.

Jake: Well you don't have to be hungry to go and look at the fridge! 

Amir: Ok, then maybe I shall!

Jake: You shall! 

Amir: (at window) IS THIS WHAT YOU F#CKING WANTED? I'M GONNA F#CKING KILL MYSELF 

Jake: Ok, no, look! Amir! What are you doing?

Amir: What am I doing? I'm more embarrassed than I've ever been in my entire f#cking life, and I want to end it right now!

Jake: Get off the ledge! Your going to hurt yourself

Amir: Hurt? No! The only pain I'm gonna be caused by the fact that everyone thinks I look like f#cking little Red Riding Hood!

Jake: Bo-Peep, but whatever! Please get off the ledge, your scaring us!

Amir:No! You know whats scary? Whats scary is the fact that I'm going to live my entire life as the guy who...wore weird clothes. Womens clothes in that picture....that you put on the fridge.

Jake: No one- No one here is going to think of you like that, right guys?

Guy 1: Well.... I might...

Guy 2: We'll probably remember you as the guy who killed himself.

Jake: Look man! I was teasing you as a friend! I was teasing you!

Amir: As a friend?
