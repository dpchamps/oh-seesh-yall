Amir: Whateva

[Starts, Jake and Amir sitting across from each other like usual. Amir with a subtle grin and his head being supported by his fists.]

Jake: So no computer today huh?

Amir: Nah. I figure I never do any work on it, so why bring it into work?

Jake: Well, at least it's refreshingly honest.

Amir: Oh by the way, Shanah Tova...so. 

Jake: What? 

Amir: It means "Happy new year" in Hebrew. It's the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah.

Jake: That's nice. Alright, thank you. 

Amir: You...don't...know...Hebrew, do you?

Jake: No.

Amir sound surprised.

Amir: Oh my god.

Jake: I don't...I don't get it.

Listen up, bitch. Here are the rules. When I speak in Hebrew, and you reply.   

Your reply, though in English is still binding. Do you agree? If so, say yes.

Jake: Okay. I don't get what you're saying, but you're tone is getting kind of creepy so-

Amir: I just asked if your shirt was grey.

Jake: Yes Amir, my shirt is grey.
