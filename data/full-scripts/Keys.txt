Episode

(Jake is walking through the office when Amir comes to join him)

Amir: Sup! (Drops his keys) Er, ah.

Jake: Dropped something.

Amir: No, impossible. I don't drop shit, I don't pick shit up; that's kinda my ish. So.

Jake: You don't drop shit, but you dropped your keys.

Amir: Haha—(grabs the back of Jake's head and speaks directly into his face) I've never dropped anything, ever.

Jake: Let go of my head, right?

Amir: Okay.

Jake: What did Ricky say about touching me?

Amir: He said maybe, sometimes, if you asked politely.

Jake: He said never.

Amir: Okay.

Jake: So those aren't your keys.

Amir: Neh.

Jake: Neh.

Amir: Neh.

Jake: Neh.

Amir: NEH!

Jake: (Picks up the keys) These aren't yours?

Amir: Nope.

Jake: (Throwing the keys away) So that's fine.

Amir: Ahh, yep, that's coo. That's coo.

Jake: That's cOO. Okay, that's coo. How are you gonna act like you're too proud for anything when your pants are on backwards right 
now?

Amir: Yeah, righ.

Jake: Unzip your fly?

Amir: My regular fly? Or my butt fly?

Jake: Let's do the regular fly just cause a butt fly isn't a real thing.

Amir: Okay, good idea. But, lemme do my butt fly first, and then if we have time I will do my regular one. How does that sound?

Jake: Where do you have to be? That's a good question. Where do you have to be?

Amir: I have to call my landlord, if you must know, because I misplaced my keys this morning.

Jake: Totally unrelated incident, I got it.

Amir: Yes.

Jake: Where's your phone?

Amir: It's in my back—front pocket. (Takes the phone out of his back pocket, which is at the front since his pants are on backwards) 
It's in my back-front po—(drops his phone)

Jake: You didn't drop that.

(Amir shakes his head)

Jake: No.

(Amir points to his hand as if he's on the phone)
