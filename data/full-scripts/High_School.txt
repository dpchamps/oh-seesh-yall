INTRO:

AMIR: (in a strange unknown accent) Hola, sir wachin Jake and Amar.

JAKE: Not Spanish.

AMIR: Wasn't trying to be.



[Jake, Murph, and Rosie are sitting in chairs in a break room.]

MURPH: Do you guys remember how small our dicks were in high school?

(Rosie laughs)

JAKE: In high school, yeahyeah.

MURPH: God, it was like..

JAKE: I had the peenie-- the teeniest tiny little thing.

MURPH: Seriously.

ROSIE: Yeah, I'm just so happy there wasn't, like, sexting back then, cuz I would just like--

JAKE: Oh, man--

ROSIE: --my tiny dick would be all over the internet, like--

(All laugh.)

(The sound of a door closing is heard. The camera cuts to Amir, who has just entered the room, with a completely blank expression.)

AMIR: Hey.

JAKE: Hey, what's up, man?--

AMIR: Where are you, man?

JAKE: ...I'm right here! You can see me, right?

AMIR: Yeyeah. I know.

AMIR: Say it!

JAKE: Peace out.

AMIR: What was that?

JAKE: My phone vibrated.

AMIR: (still in the room, turning to face Jake) Leaving!

JAKE: You're just standing there!

AMIR: (pointing at the door handle) This door handle is so gay.

JAKE: Turn it!

AMIR: I don't even wanna touch it!

JAKE: (to Murph and Rosie) One second. (He gets up and walks over to Amir.) Okay, what's going on, man?

AMIR: Nothing, I just wanna hang out with you and your friends.

JAKE: Come on, we'll hang out later.

AMIR: NOT later, I wanna hang out now, I'm bored now!

JAKE: (sighs) You're not going to have any fun, ok?

AMIR: I'll have fun.

JAKE: You really wanna hang out with me and my friends?

(Amir nods.)

JAKE: Just know that I don't want you there. Murph and Rosie don't want you there. (AMIR: That's fine) But if you really want to go over there you can.

AMIR: Yes, I want to.

JAKE: Ok, even though none of us want you there.

AMIR: Mmhmm. Yes.

JAKE: Alright, fine, you can go sit down, but just kno--

AMIR: Aight then MOVE! (pushing past Jake to walk over to Murph and Rosie and sit down in Jake's chair)

JAKE: There you go. Ok. (He turns around and sits next to Murph, then addresses Murph and Rosie.) Amir's gonna hand out with us for a little bit.

AMIR: (holding his arms out and smiling) uEEIHHH! (laughs)

JAKE: But he has to leave soon, because he has to get back to work--

AMIR: No! I don't work... any of that stuff. Anyway, what are you guys talking about? Trucks,--

JAKE: [We were] Talking about high school.

AMIR: (laughing) I used to make Jackass-style videos in high school.

ROSIE: Oh really? (he and Murph laugh along) Me and my friends used to do that too.

AMIR: (laughing) Yeah, lots of grocery carts to-- (laughs) One time my friend Austin tried to like longboard off the side of a house onto like an empty pool, but his like truck got caught in a shingle and he ended up, like, clipping his head on the side of the pool. (laughs)

(All but Amir go ohhhh and laugh at the black humor.)
