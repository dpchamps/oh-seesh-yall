AMIR: Hey, you're watching me and my best friend!

JAKE: Not cute.

AMIR: Yes. I. Am!



[POV: A camera which Jake has just set to record with a remote.]

JAKE: Okay, it's recording.

AMIR: Okay. Well-- don't go anywhere, 'cuz I need a witness!

JAKE: You said all I had to do was set up the camera.

AMIR: Well I need a witness!

[Jake stops the recording.]



[Jake begins the recording again.]

AMIR: Okay. Uh, I'm Amir Blumenfeld, and this is my... certified... emergency medical assistant--

JAKE: I'm not certified.

AMIR: --it's fine-- Jake Hurwitz. Uh, and, I'm gonna be trying to break the world record for longest time holding your breath.

JAKE: [to the camera] I'm not certified.

AMIR: Rrrrrrgh. Okay. Uh, this is a verbal agreement, because we both understand... the inherent risk involved in this stunt, and we both agree to pay... twenty-five hundred dollars to the Guinness Book of World Records if this video is fraudulent. I agree. Do you agree? Just say yes.

JAKE: I obviously don't agree.

AMIR: Well what the fu--



AMIR: I agree. Do you agree?

JAKE: I agree, because you agree to pay the entire fine if that happens. Right?

AMIR: [pause] Let's get started.

[Jake stops the recording.]



AMIR: Okay, fine. I agree to pay the whole thing. Let's just-- do this; you're messing me up.

JAKE: Fine.

AMIR: Alright. This is attempt number one.

[Amir inhales sharply. He is perfectly silent for a few seconds, then he begins breathing through his nose. His breathing becomes very loud and conspicuous.]

JAKE: Okay, I think you're breathing through your nose.

AMIR: Alright, cut.



AMIR: Longest holding-of-breath, attempt number one.

JAKE: It's attempt number two.

AMIR: Just-- okay. It's just a little more impressive if I do it in one! Right? It's so obvious that that's what I was tr--



AMIR: Attempt number one.

[Amir inhales sharply again. He immediately resorts to breathing through his nose. Jake reaches over and plugs Amir's nose. Amir begins panicking and flailing around, then opens his mouth to breathe.]

AMIR: What the hell was that?

JAKE: You're clearly cheating.

AMIR: You're a f**king narc.



AMIR: Okay, attempt number one.

[Amir cracks his knuckles, inhales sharply, and then holds his breath. This time, he also plugs his own nose. He stands in silence for a few seconds. Eventually, he takes his finger off the left side of his nose so he can breathe through one nostril.]

JAKE: They can see that.

AMIR: Because you said something!

[Amir grabs the remote.]

AMIR: So... cut. [tries to find the right button] Which one?

JAKE: That.



AMIR: Okay, attempt number one.

[Amir inhales sharply. This time, he pinches his nose as well as his lips, so that there is no way to breathe. After a second or two, he slightly releases pressure from his lips. The air-sucking sound is very loud and obvious.]

JAKE: God, that's worse than before. Cut.

[Jake hits the button lightly; it doesn't cut.]

AMIR: Rrrrgh.

JAKE: Alright: what are you doing?

AMIR: We can always ed--... th-- edit that part out.

JAKE: Why edit? Why cheat? Why are you trying to cheat?

AMIR: Because I'm trying to-- make it impressive; I wanna get in the Book.

JAKE: Okay, let's just do one honest attempt. Okay? No cheating.

AMIR: ...Okay. No cheating.

JAKE: No cheating.

AMIR: Start.

JAKE: Ready?



[Amir has collapsed, and is breathing deep gasps of air. Jake is helping him to his feet.]

JAKE: Oh my God!

AMIR: Cut it!

JAKE: I cut it. I cut it.

AMIR: Aaaah, I browned out!

JAKE: You browned out! Oh, man!

AMIR: I browned out, but I survived! How long was that?

JAKE: Seventeen minutes! That's amazing!

AMIR: [deep breathing] Gahhhhhhh...

JAKE: Oh my God!

AMIR: I browned out!

JAKE: Oh, you browned out!

AMIR: Hey, wait, why is that red light on?

JAKE: Is the red light on?

AMIR: Yeah.

[Jake walks up to the camera.]

AMIR: ...You recorded it, right?

JAKE: Ohhh, no, no, no...

AMIR: You did get it, though?

JAKE: I definitely got it. Don't worry.

AMIR: Okay, good. I trust y--



END



[Three weeks later, Amir is checking the mail. He sees a letter from Guinness and gasps.]

AMIR: Ohhh, ohhhhhh...

[Amir quickly rips open the letter, unfolds the now-crumpled message, and reads it.]

AMIR: [quickly, excitedly] Dear Mister Blumenfeld, thank you very much for your submission, we regret to inform you, though, [slows down] that this is a fine. Ohhhh no, [rips the letter in frustration] Jake, we got the f-- we got the fine...
