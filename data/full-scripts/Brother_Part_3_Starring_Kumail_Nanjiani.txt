INTRO: Jake - Hey, you're watching Jake an--

Amir - I'm really, really sorry. I just have to pee, one second. 

Jake - Damn it. 

Amir - Sorry.



JAKE: Remember when I was 4 and you were 11 and you stole Robbie McGuiness's bike and you blamed it on me, and his friends beat the s**t out of me? 

(They laugh)

KUMAIL: Yeah, how many stitches did you get for that?

JAKE: Forty-eight! You didn't even try to stop them! (chuckles)

KUMAIL: Stop them?! I told them where you were! 

(They laugh some more) 

KUMAIL: Hey, can I borrow 50 bucks?

JAKE: Yeah man, why?

KUMAIL: Oh, so curious. That's why we called you the 'Curious C**k'. 

(Jake laughs)

KUMAIL: Make it 60.

JAKE: Absolutely, I'm going to go to the ATM. (Jake leaves)

(Kumail gets onto Jake's computer)

KUMAIL: Geez, he doesn't save any of his Bank of America passwords. 

AMIR: How's your business plan?

KUMAIL: Oh, my business plan of stealing money from Jake? It's going really well, thanks for asking.

AMIR: You know he trusts you.

KUMAIL: Yeah. I know. That's why he's giving me all his money.  Geez, you are dumb.

AMIR: What's you goal-I mean, what's your goal here, I guess. 

KUMAIL: It's called flying in your Russian girlfriend to Miami so that you can start a new life with her. Geez, what don't you get about this scheme?     

AMIR: I-I get it, I guess. I just, I don't know, I never, I didn't-I didn't know what the scheme was. 

KUMAIL: You know what? I'm leaving tonight, so keep your trap shut until then and we'll be all good. 

(Jake is returning)

AMIR: Yeah, tell me about your scheme--

JAKE:  Hallo, mate! 'ere you go, 100 big ones! Forty extra so you don't have to ask again. 

KUMAIL: Thanks.

AMIR: Jake, can I, uh, actually speak to you tonight, in private, please? 

JAKE: Ooo yeah, that's tempting but f**k no. I'm going camping with Kumail this weekend (Kumail mouths 'No we're not') and I have to go home and pack. 

KUMAIL: All right, Jake buddy, I am out. Remember our plan, OK?

JAKE: Absolutely, we meet outside the Harlem train station at midnight, with all our gear including the biggest tent imaginable--

KUMAIL AND JAKE:  And don't take a cab!! 

JAKE: (laughs) See you then! 

THE END.
