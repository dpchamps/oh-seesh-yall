INTRO

AMIR: (southern accent) Welcome down to the Jake and Amir barbecue. Things are getting-

JAKE: Oh my God.

AMIR: (interrupting) What?

JAKE: I hate you!

EPISODE

AMIR: (sighs) My God, look at that! Look at it!

JAKE: What?

AMIR: That guy's being so reckless with his roller bag.

JAKE: He's standing next to it.

AMIR: He's not even keeping an eye on the roller. Like, ehe!

JAKE: Chill, why do you care?

AMIR: 'Cause I'm passionate about a lot of things, OK man, and suitcase theft aint one of 'em.

JAKE: So then you don't care.

AMIR: Usually not, but like, ahh, I really feel like I gotta teach that guy a lesson or something.

JAKE: Don't teach anybody a lesson, alright, you don't know reading.

AMIR: Well I know enough to spell suitcase, Ok and that guy's not treating his with any respect.

JAKE: Spell suitcase.

AMIR: Swy, U, I, D, K, A, A, Y, C, E!

JAKE: (As Amir is spelling) Wrong, wrong, you're wrong, you're so quickly wrong, you're wrong right off the bat don't fight me on it, Ok? Stop yelling.

AMIR: Ok, if I can jack that guy's suitcase will you admit that I'm right?

JAKE: About what, the spelling?

AMIR: About (brief pause) everything!

JAKE: Ok, no, because none of the letters were correct, and also, you know, he's not being that reckless with his suitcase 'cause he's standing pretty close to it, in a building, with security, surrounded by regular, employed adults.

AMIR: That cool cat thinks he can hot dog.

JAKE: Great, you've stopped listening to me.

AMIR: I'm about to go kangaroo jack his roller backpack. (chuckles)

JAKE: Bad joke-

AMIR: Shh!

JAKE: Alright.

(Amir gets up and runs, grabbing the suitcase)

AMIR: Sneak attack!

(Man immediately grabs it as well)

MAN: Hey!

AMIR: Hey, Ok, you just failed the reckless test, sir, that's right I could've jacked this if you weren't keeping a close eye on it.

MAN: Let it go.

(Amir lets go)

AMIR: Why? So you can just turn a blind eye to all your belongings? What's in there? Open it up!

MAN: No!

AMIR: Alright. Just (brief pause) cool it!

MAN: Don't talk to me, don't touch my things.

AMIR: I won't. If you promise me, you gotta promise me, right now, that you're gonna-

MAN: Go fuck yourself!

AMIR: I'm going. Alright, I'm going to fuck myself, sir, but you gotta admit-

MAN: Leave!

AMIR: You learned a lesson-

MAN: Leave!

AMIR: Lesson learned, right, hey! (to Jake) You takin' notes here? Ya fat cow!

JAKE: You know, you left your wallet, open, on your desk. 

AMIR: What? Whatever.

JAKE: You have cash spilling out of the back of your jeans.

AMIR: (Turning around, dropping cash) What-ever, I said! (Reaches for bag again) Sneak attack, number two.

(Man grabs it back)

MAN: Hey!

AMIR: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoah-

MAN: I told you-

AMIR: Oh-ho, yeah.
