INTRO

AMIR: (Singing The Pink Panther theme song)

JAKE: Just say our names!

AMIR: It's The Pink Panther theme!



(Amir is taking pictures of Jake with a disposable camera)

JAKE: (Rolls eyes)  Hey can you...

(Amir pulls film out of camera)

JAKE: You have to develop film, you know?  You're destroying it.  

AMIR: (Unrolling film) Not that you care.

JAKE: You know what?  I don't, because I don't want a scrapbook.   

AMIR: (Takes film and wraps it around the book) Not a scrapbook, okay?  A memory book.

JAKE: You've called it a scrapbook, like, fifteen times since you got here.  Look at the cover.  (Gestures towards the book)

AMIR: Ohhhhhh (Covers the 'Scrap' part of the "Scrapbook" title with his hand)

JAKE: That doesn't change what it says. 

AMIR: Okay, sorry for tying to commemorate your three year, five month, nine week—

JAKE: A couple more months then.

AMIR: anniversary!

JAKE: (Shakes head)  Let me see it.

(Amir takes film off of book and hands it to Jake)

JAKE: (Looking at book)  Wow there are baby pictures in here—

AMIR: (Sarcasm)  Ouuu

JAKE: of both of us somehow

AMIR: (Sarcasm) Big whoop.

JAKE: It is a big whoop, it's a huge whoop; you made us slow dancing.  

AMIR: Photoshop.

JAKE: Jesus, both of our families at Disney Land together?  Our dads are kissing!  Why would you do that?

AMIR: It's funny.

JAKE: You in high school with Dane Cook.

(Real picture of Amir and Dane Cook is shown in the scrapbook)

AMIR: (Making Su-Fi hand sign) The Dane Train!  ((Puts hand down) Haha (Brings hand up) Su-fi. 

JAKE: Why would you even want to include this in my scrapbook?

AMIR: Alright, keep flipping and you'll find yourself a chapter two: The Noticed Unoticed.

JAKE: Don't narrate it, please.

AMIR: Basically, me in the background of all your important life events: your birth, your Bar Mitzvah, your Quinceañera. 

JAKE: (Flipping though scrapbook) Didn't have a Quinceañera—Oh (Sees  Quinceañera picture) I did.

AMIR: Yeah.

JAKE: Very nice.

AMIR: That's at Chili's too.

JAKE: In an airport.

AMIR: Yeah, LaGuardia.

JAKE: Got it.

AMIR: Look at that nice pink dress.

JAKE: Hey, Man, bad news.

AMIR: What?

JAKE: New rule: if I flip this next page, you're a nerd.  

AMIR: (Laughs nervously) ...What?

JAKE: Yeah, I just have to flip this next page and you're a nerd.

AMIR: So don't do it.  (More nervous laughter)

JAKE: But I really wanna see the other pictures.

AMIR: (Panic) I-k-k-k-k-know, but it's not worth it. 

JAKE: It's worth it to me.

AMIR: No! (Throws film cap at Jake and misses) Hey!

JAKE: Hey, hey, hey (About to flip page)

AMIR: N-N-N-N-N-NO, NO!

JAKE: (Flips page fully) Oh god!  You're a nerd now!  

AMIR: (Facepalming) NO!

JAKE: (Flipping page again) Sorry that you're not—(Sees next page and rolls eyes) You Photoshopped a vagina onto yourself and you're masturbating?  

AMIR: (Takes palm off face) Is that a question or?

JAKE: (Slams down scrapbook between their desks)

AMIR: So you're just done?

JAKE: I'm done!
