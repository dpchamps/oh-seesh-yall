INTRO

BEN: You're listening to Jake and Ameesh!

JAKE: Watching it, actually.

AMIR: Amir. Is my name.



[Jake and Amir are not at their desks. They seem to be waiting for somebody.]

AMIR: I spent a lot of time in high school doing Habitat for Humanity - you know, building houses - but instead of real nails, I would use these dissolvable sugar studs that I would get at novelty stores, and, like, always: six months later, I would check the news, and that house would - BOOM [snap] - collapse. Two dead, three dead, four at a time, just gone.

JAKE: What the hell is wrong with you?

[The interrogator, here referred to as Ben, enters.]

BEN: (singing) Hey diddly-dee, a sailors life for-- [abruptly stops singing] How are you? How is everything? This is what's happening: I'm goin' around this office, asking people-- because you know what happened? Some party pooper took a dump inside the copier, and I'm tryin' to find out who it was...

JAKE: Inside the machine?

BEN: Inside-- they lifted up the glass, took a quick feces [pronounced f'SEEZ] inside, and closed the glass again!

JAKE: Oh my God...

BEN: It's crazy, isn't it?

JAKE: So you're interrogating people?

BEN: Um, am I an interrogator is what he asks, and my answer is - gimme one second, I gotta double-check the facts, ummmm...

[Ben studies a list reading:

Dating Coach
Couples Therapist
Private Eye
Office Painter
H. R. Guy
Mountain Hiker
Interrogator]

BEN: ...Interrogator, yeaaah! That's what I am.

JAKE: What's that list?

[Jake tries to grab the list but Ben puts it away.]

BEN: Nonono, we'll keep this right here. I'm an interrogator but I'm a guy you've never seen before. Never seen me in a million years!

JAKE: [to Amir] He looks familiar, right?

AMIR: No.

JAKE: That's because he's that guy that, like, can't come up with the names.

BEN: I can prove you wrong, 'cuz I have a perfectly normal name.

JAKE: What's your name?

BEN: ...Carrot.

JAKE: That's... a normal name for a food.

BEN: Thank youuuu, thank youuuu.

JAKE: What's your last name?

BEN: Slat.

JAKE: Carrot Slat?

BEN: Carrot Slat.

JAKE: That's not normal.

BEN: Why is that not normal?

JAKE: [to Amir] Do you think that's normal?

AMIR: Sometimes, I'll go someplace, and... my name's not normal. But, like, where are you from?

BEN: I'm from Virginia.

JAKE: What are your parents' names?

[long pause]

BEN: Sorry, I was thinking of that, um... Don't Worry, Be Happy song. What'd you say? [beat] Now I'm gonna ask you something; just answer honestly.

AMIR: Okay.

BEN: Quick one-two punch: Um, what's your favorite color?

JAKE: Color... um, green.

BEN: Great! Thanks so much. And did you do it?

JAKE: Do what?

BEN: Did you take a shit in the copier?

JAKE: No.

BEN: [brandishing a closed umbrella like a microphone] Amir, Amir: do you dress yourself in the morning? [holds the mic to Amir]

AMIR: [as if being interviewed] Uhhhh, no I do not.

BEN: [mic to himself] Ahahaha! Okay then, who does, or how do you dress yourself? [mic to Amir]

AMIR: Either a relative will help me, or I will upload a video of myself--

BEN: [mic to himself] And do you have frequent bowel movements? [mic to Amir]

AMIR: Frequent flyer miles?

BEN: [mic to himself] Do you have frequent bowel movements? [mic to Amir]

AMIR: Oh, like, do I... t--

BEN: [mic to himself] Do you take a lot of shits? [mic to Amir]

AMIR: Yes.

BEN: [mic to himself] Okay, cool. So, how often in a day will you take a shit? [mic to Amir]

AMIR: Forty.

BEN: [mic to himself] Forty shits? [mic to Amir]

JAKE: Jesus Christ...

AMIR: Well, sometimes I'll take, like, one or less, like thirty-nine, but yeah. Thirty-nine or forty. [to Jake] Right?

BEN: Crazy!

JAKE: In a day?

AMIR: How much is r-- how much is good?

BEN: [mic to himself] I take, like, twenty!

JAKE: That's also really high.

BEN: Seems pretty good to me.

JAKE: Both of you guys are shitting way too much.

BEN: [mic to Jake] You're shitting way too much.

JAKE: I shit once a week.

BEN: [mic to himself] That's way too much.

JAKE: What the hell kind of interview is this?

BEN: That's it. [slams the table] That's it! No more cool laid-back dude! It's all fuckin' over now! Now you get the shit! Okay? Now you get the fuckin' shit!

AMIR: ...What did we have before?

BEN: Oh my God...
