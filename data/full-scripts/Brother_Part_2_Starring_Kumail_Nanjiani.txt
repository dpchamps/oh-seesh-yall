INTRO: (silence) Amir- Ah, sorry I'm late. Uh, you're watching Jake and Amir.



AMIR: So, how was dinner last night with your long lost bro? 

JAKE: Uh, it was good.  It was expensive, but it was good. 

AMIR: Sounds good. Sounds expensive but it was good. 

JAKE: You're just repeating what I say. 

AMIR: Can't prove that. Why was it expensive?

JAKE: Uh, it's just that Kumail doesn't have like any money right now so I had to pay.

AMIR: He doesn't have any money? 

JAKE: No. Not right now. But he has like this insanely good business idea which is why I invested my last $5,000 in it, and uh, it's going to make both of us rich. 

AMIR: Insanely good business idea? 

JAKE: Yeah, it's called scale.com. You step on your laptop and the site will actually weigh you.

AMIR: OK. That's MY idea, BITCH!

JAKE: I'm kidding! You think I would tell you the business idea? I don't even know it yet. 

AMIR: But you said it was insanely good?

JAKE: It's called trusting someone. Your brother.

AMIR: My brother? 

JAKE: My brother.

AMIR: Your brother?

JAKE: Shut up, all right? Nevermind. 

AMIR: Jake, I don't think Kumail is the trustworthy guy you think he is. 

JAKE: Why? Because I want to hang out with him more than I want to hang out with you?
AMIR: Yes, that. And yesterday when you were in the bathroom, he was like digging around, looking for pay stubs or whatever.

JAKE: Wow.

AMIR: Yeah, so . . . 

JAKE: You've kept me from my own surprise party, you've spied on me in the bathroom, you poisoned my food, but this is a new low. 

AMIR: Yes, but have I ever lied to you?

JAKE: Yeah, sure. You told me you had 60 beers once.  You said you never drop anything. You said you had some new girlfriend--

AMIR: OK, shut up! 

JAKE: NO, YOU SHUT UP! My brother is finally back and I'm happy and he's going to make us both rich and for once I'm not going to let you f**k it up for me. 

AMIR: Frine!

JAKE: Frine or fine?

AMIR: I don't know, why don't you ask your brother. He seems to know everything!

JAKE: You know what? Maybe I will, because he's in the kitchen right now and we're going to get lunch together, bitch!

AMIR: You're a bitch!  

JAKE: You're a bitch.

AMIR: You're the bitch. 

JAKE: You're a bitch's bitch. (beat) Nothing? 

AMIR: You're a ... bitch's bitch.

(Kumail is in the kitchen with Sarah attempting to juggle) 

KUMAIL: You know, Jake said he worked with a bunch of 5's and 6's but you are a legit 7. 

SARAH: (chuckles apprehensively) Uh, thanks. 

KUMAIL: I probably see myself doing you if you know what I mean?

SARAH: Wow, that's pretty clear--

JAKE: Hey, Sarah!  Did you meet my brother, Kumail?

SARAH: Yeah, just did. 

JAKE: Cool.

KUMAIL: Lunch time?

JAKE: Absolutely man, where to?

KUMAIL: Wherever. You're paying. (they laugh) Come on.

SARAH: No. Why would I ever -- (an orange is thrown violently at the wall next to Sarah) 

THE END.
