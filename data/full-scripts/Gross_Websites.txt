No Intro



JAKE: Oh man, come over here and look at this picture.

AMIR: Why?

JAKE: Just come over here and look at it.

AMIR: Just turn your monitor around.

JAKE: Oh god- Come over here, I want to see your face.

AMIR: I know it's going to be one of those disgusting sites.

JAKE: No-

The phone rings.

JAKE: Oh shit hold on. To the phone Hello?

AMIR: Get off the phone though.

JAKE: To the phone Hello? Mom?

AMIR: Okay, if it's personal you should definitely get off the phone.

JAKE: To the phone Mom are you crying? Are you okay?

AMIR: Jake get off the phone.

JAKE: To the phone Mom, are you okay?

AMIR: It's before six. You're not supposed to be making personal phone calls before six.

JAKE: To the phone What-what's going on?

AMIR: Earth to Jake: get off the phone. It's so annoying.

JAKE: To the phone When?

AMIR: No personal calls before six, that's a rule, and the reason it's a rule is because it annoys people when you talk.

JAKE: To the phone Oh my god. Is he going to be okay?

AMIR: If he's going to be okay he's going to be okay at six, if he's not okay he's going to be still dead at six.

JAKE: Can you shut up? To the phone Do you need me to call Hannah?

AMIR: Seriously, if you're going to call your sister, go out, do it in the lunch room, on your cell phone-

JAKE: Please leave me alone right now. To the phone I love you call me if you hear anything else.

Jake hangs up the phone.

AMIR: Oh I'm sorry are you crying because I disciplined you? Well guess what Jake? This is the real world; there are rules and bosses discipline their employees if they break those rules, right? 

JAKE: You're not my boss and just shut up, I may have lost my dad today.

AMIR: Okay, wow. I didn't realize you guys were so close. Come on man, let's go get fro-yo or something. Do you have five bucks? Do you have five bucks though because I don't think I have- I don't think I have it on me. I really think it will cheer you up.
