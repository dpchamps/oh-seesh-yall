Amir: Can you send me an email just to see if it works? To my Gmail?

Jake: I will transmit it to your brain!

Amir: Yes, do send me the data! Oo, the king requests the information to be sent to me, forthwith! Quickly now!

Jake: Stop.

Amir: Quickly.

Jake: Alright, I get it.

Amir: Oo, before they see us.

Jake: Just quit it!

Amir: Oo, the prince comes! He comes and goes, he doesn't know what Michelangelo knows.

Jake: Would you please chill out?

Amir: Oh! Oh! Oh! (Picks up a coffee cup) A car! Oo, what hark, the king requests me—

Jake: Stop it, please.

Amir: —drew the information upon your chest!

Jake: Don't do anything like—

Amir: Mm, don't you know—

Jake: What the hell are you doing?!

Amir: Sorry.

Jake: No. I try to have a little bit of fun, and you just take it too far, every fucking time!

Amir: You've changed, man. You've changed.

Jake: Oh have I—!
