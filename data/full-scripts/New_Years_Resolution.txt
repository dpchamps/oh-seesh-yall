AMIR: New Year's resolutions, shoot!

JAKE: No.

AMIR: K, mmm, mine's for you to be nicer to me.

JAKE: Not a resolution.  That's not how they work.

AMIR: K.  I have another one.  But-

JAKE: What is it?

AMIR: Stupid, so stupid, heh. It's for me to be more confident, or not, whatever.

JAKE: How's that working out for you?

AMIR: S-I should just do my original resolution, and that's it.

JAKE: What's that?

AMIR: To lose weight.  That's pretty normal.  I saw a commercial for that.

JAKE: How much do you weigh?

AMIR: One-twelve.

JAKE: Ohh.

AMIR: With shoes!

JAKE: You're on the cusp of being grossly underweight.

AMIR: (nods his head) What's average? ish?

JAKE: I don't know, like, one sixty.

AMIR: Okay.  Close, but no cidah.  

JAKE: No what?

AMIR: Close, but no sid-cider.

JAKE: Spell it.

AMIR: Swy D R.

JAKE: You know, you never cease to impress me-

(Amir smiles)

JAKE: -and not in a good way, how dumb you are.

AMIR: You wonder why I don't have any confidence, or whatev-

JAKE: What did you say, idiot?

AMIR: Nothing.

(silence)

AMIR: Jake.
