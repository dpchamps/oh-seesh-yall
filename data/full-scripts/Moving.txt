Jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.

Amir: I'm still in the room, okay?

Jake: ...Yup.



Amir: T, U, V, W, X, Y, und... Z! Z, Z, Z, Z, Z. Z, Z, Z, Z!

Jake: Great—Yes, I got it! Great job, man. Maybe next time you start—

Amir: Start before T? Okay, don't even think about it; you know I'm dyslexic.

Jake: You're not dyslexic.

Amir: Lazy.

Jake: You're illiterate.

Amir: Cute.

Jake: Illiterate.

Amir: Ah!

Jake: No! No, I know what that look is; you just convinced yourself that I said you were cute, and not illiterate.

Amir: I will take you calling me cute over illiterate... every day, okay?

Jake: Any day, and I know you'd take that. I'm not giving it, okay? I didn't say you were cute. [Amir dances rapidly in seat.] No, what is that? Do you think I'm singing you a very fast-paced song?

Amir: Techno.

Jake: Okay, you know what, forget it. I'm—wow, do you see this email?

Amir: What's up?

Jake: Did you see it, or are you asking what's up?

Amir: _____, I'm looking for it now.

Jake: We're moving offices.

Amir: (gasps) Holy moving, Batmat!

Jake: Did you say, Batmat?

Amir: No...

Jake: Okay, it is a big deal, all right? It's gonna be a totally different office.

Amir: Oh my god, a totally different office? Oh no, it won't be the same office! (dramatically fakes crying)

Jake: Your commute might be a lot longer!

Amir: (gasps) My commute? WHY? Oh god, why is my commute gonna be longer? It's gonna be cold; I'm gonna need a scarf! [Jake: Okay.] Where do I get a scarf?

Jake: Forget it! The one upside to this is maybe I won't have to sit next to you anymore.

Amir: OH N—Oh.. no! Really? What? Why not? Where would you—where would you sit?

Jake: Are you actually crying now?

Amir: I don't know.
