INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're not watching Jake and Amir!

JAKE: What?

AMIR: Reverse psychology.

JAKE: It's not.

AMIR: It is!



[Jake and Amir are both on their laptops. Amir yelps incredulously at something on his screen, but gags a little. Amir gag-yelps again, then a third time.]

JAKE: React internally.

AMIR: [gesturing at his screen] Get this guy out of my country; get this guy out of my life, dude!

[Jake shakes his head.]

AMIR: I'm sick of this TMZ tweeny-bopper Canadian lesbo ass, dude!

[Jake doesn't react.]

AMIR: [stammering, gagging] It makes me want to puke or something, dude!

JAKE: Dude! Dude, dude! Do your work! [Amir makes a face at Jake] Answer emails.

AMIR: [using air quotes, doing hand motions] Everything Justin Bieber does is a "blunder", and so I think we should send his ass back down under.

JAKE: Back-- he's from Canada. You just knew that.

AMIR: Either way, this Mongoloid ass needs to be deported for his actions, or lack thereof!

JAKE: What didn't he do?

AMIR: [shrug] He's just obnoxious.

JAKE: That's it?

AMIR: [shrugging excessively] He's just a little obnoxious. He just rubs me the wrong way, in a way. [chuckles] He's a little Johnny Obnoxville.

JAKE: He's-- ...sorry, you can't deport someone because they annoy you.

AMIR: This motherfucker is ruining the lamestream media, with these pop-up, tabloid, e-zine, blog, link bait, listicle bullshit! Okay? I can't-- they're just covering his downward spiral; it's disgusting! Look, visit my Facebook wall. I post about these things pretty often, actually, they're-- [chuckling] --they're actually really funny! They're great! [laughing]

JAKE: You just said you didn't like them, [looking down at his laptop] and wow. Buddy, you are a major part of the problem. Don't you think? You post about these stories all the time on Facebook! Your last one just says "Buck Fieber"... nice.

AMIR: I'm serious, dude. Buck him! Yeah, why does he get all this attention? He doesn't deserve it! Just... just thinking about it, literally all the time, makes me sick to my stomach!

JAKE: You know, you're giving him a lot of attention.

AMIR: Yeah, 'cause he's a basket case! He's a car crash, and I can't look away! Also, belieb it or not, I'm... I'mma kind of obsessed with this little fucker.

JAKE: Of course I belieb that! That's very beliebable.

AMIR: I have Bieber fever in a way. Okay? Diarrhea and all.

JAKE: I think you might just have diarrhea.

AMIR: I'm actually starting a Facebook group.

JAKE: Wow, you look sick.

AMIR: If you care to join it, it's called, uh, "Deport Justin Bieber Before I Faint"! [struggling to speak]

JAKE: Alright, yes. You definitely just have a stomach bug. Take up a real issue. Alright? Focus on something a little more important than this celebrity bullshit.

AMIR: Holy shit, did you see this TMZ video of Justin Bieber pissing in a bucket? [laughing]

JAKE: It's really old.

AMIR: You can actually kind of see Justin's balls in it. It's... it's pretty hot. [fanning himself by shaking his shirt collar] I'm sweating.

JAKE: Yeah, you have the flu! You're pale, you're angry, you're dripping with sweat. Go home for the day.

AMIR: I'm fine. I'm just freezing, and... [pause] puking a little.

JAKE: Oh, that's a lot of puke!

[Amir is vomiting on himself.]

AMIR: Oh shit, dude! 'Gram it! 'Gram this, and DM it to Justin. I have... I have giardia for this tween fuck!
