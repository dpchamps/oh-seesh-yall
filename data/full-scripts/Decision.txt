Amir: (on phone) Jake, hey, uhh it's Amir. I just, I guess give me a call when you get this. I wanted to see what was going on...

Jake: Amir, you've left me like a hundred voicemails ever since I said I was coming back!

Rosie: Whoa Jake!

Pat: Ah, there he is.

Jeff: Look who's come back.

Rosie: Hurwitz, man.

Jeff: Look who's come crawling back.

Pat: Welcome back, man!

Rosie: Yeah, how's Kelly? Tell us everything.

Jake: Ah, it was awesome. I worked with the hottest girl.

Pat: Yeah, you make it happen my dude?

Jake: Almost.

Jeff: Even Amir made out with his co-worker, and you didn't?

Rosie and Pat: (laughs)

Rosie: Yo, so why'd you come back?

Jake: I don't know, umm... It just wasn't for me.

Pat: Well, it's good to have you back, Jake.

Jake: Jacob, it's Jacob now.

Rosie: No.

Jake: (taps Pat) Hey, what do you think about a goatee on me?

Pat: Ahaha, you almost had me, man.

Jake: ... My hair parted... nah.

Pat: You're back.

Jake: Stupid. (goes to sit across from Amir)

Pat: (in the distance) Oh Lord!

Jake: Hey

Amir: SUUU-errr-hey. Do you- Are you interested in a dinner, tonight? With me?

Jake: Let me guess, the Ds?

Amir: I mean, we don't have to, like wherever you want is fine-

Jake: I could do the Ds.

Jake and Amir: (smile at each other)

Jake: Fuck it, come here. (stands up)

Jake and Amir: (have a super bromantic hug)

Jake: Hey, did you make out with a guy?

Amir: Yeah, it was weird.
