(caption - Jake and Amir Behind the Scenes of â€œThe Collegehumor Showâ€ Sundays at 9:30/8:30c on MTV)

AMIR: All right, we are here with Sarah Schneider, and she is an actress and a writetress on the show. 

JAKE: Thatâ€™s either a cute joke or youâ€™re a complete retard. 

AMIR: Yup.



JAKE: OK, so youâ€™re kind of like the guyâ€™s girl, right?

SARAH: Thatâ€™s right, Iâ€™m like one of the guys.

AMIR: Yeah, which guyâ€™s girl are you? 

SARAH: Th-thatâ€™s not what that phrase means. 

AMIR: Spoiler alert!

SARAh: Thatâ€™s--



(Amir and Jake are with Vinny)

JAKE: OK, weâ€™re here with Vincent Peone, who is our D.P.

AMIR: Yes, and everyone knows D.P. stands for (holds up a notepad and reads off it) Director of Photography. So, yup. (chuckles)

JAKE: So everyone knows that? 

AMIR: And he is--

JAKE: Anyone else could have memorized that.

AMIR: Heâ€™s in charge of the lightning on the set. So. 

VINNY: Uh, lighting. 

AMIR: Yes. 



AMIR: But whatâ€™s--First question. Whatâ€™s the difference between thunder and lighting?



JAKE: (softly) Sometimes we have to get to work as early as like 7AM to shoot, so a lot of us nap during the day to catch up on sleep. 

AMIR: Letâ€™s wake one of them up right now. (goes over to couch)

JAKE: (softly) Weâ€™re not going to do that.  No-No, no, no, no.  

AMIR: Streeter, Streeter we want to interview--

(Streeter gets up and pulls Amir to the floor, then begins strangling him)

STREETER: Donâ€™t wake the f**king bear! 

JAKE: OK, hold on! (Jake tries breaking them up)

STREETER: Donâ€™t wake the bear!



(Streeter is on top of Amir on the floor, Jake beside them)

STREETER: (as Jake is talking) You. Donâ€™t. Wake. Me. 

JAKE: (to cameraman) Put down the f**king camera and help!



(Jeff approaches Amir and Jake from behind)

JAKE: Oh! Ooo, Jeff Rubin, tell me what is it like--

AMIR: N-n-no, you tell me what is it like ruining every single take you are in? Sucking the life out of an otherwise great experience from everyone else?

JEFF: What-what are you guys--What is this? 



(back to Streeter on top of Amir strangling him)

AMIR: You can cut. 

STREETER: You donâ€™t wake the bear!

AMIR: You can cut. You can cut. You can cut. You can cut. You can cut.  

(Streeter starts crying with his hands still around Amirâ€™s neck)

AMIR: Itâ€™s OK, heâ€™s OK, heâ€™s OK. 



VINNY: Well, uh, you know, weâ€™re constantly faces adverse conditions with the win--

AMIR: Have you ever been struck by lighting?

VINNY: (pause) Yeah. Uh, yes. Umm, I-I guess when I walk into a lighting set up thatâ€™s profound to me, it-it sometimes is--

AMIR: I mean just like straight up a lighting bolt just (imitates getting struck by lightning)

JAKE: He gave you an out and you didnâ€™t take it. 

AMIR: What? 



(back to Sarah)

AMIR: I hate it when you look at me like Iâ€™m stupid. 

JAKE: Iâ€™ve never looked at you like you werenâ€™t stupid. 



(Just Jake and Sarah)

JAKE: All right, Sarah. Who is your favorite person to be in scenes with?

SARAH: Ooo--

AMIR (off camera): Come on, letâ€™s go, Jake.

JAKE: One second. 

AMIR: Letâ€™s go. 

SARAH: Iâ€™m trying to answer your question here. 

AMIR: Weâ€™ve already got another interview lined up with someone better. 



AMIR (still off camera): We canâ€™t use this. Iâ€™m telling you right now weâ€™re not going to use this.  

SARAH: (to Jake) Why do you hang out with him all the time? 

JAKE: I donâ€™t hang out with him all the time. 

AMIR: Yes we do. 



(back to Vinny)

AMIR: So basically youâ€™re just the guy that holds the camera, right? 

VINNY: Uh, not at all, Iâ€™m actually--

JAKE: He does a lot more. 

VINNY: --Iâ€™m responsible for the visual--

AMIR: Vinny Peone, a glorified human tripod.

VINNY: Iâ€™m responsible for the visual story telling. 

JAKE: Heâ€™s responsible for the vi--

(Amir motions to camera to cut)
