INTRO: Jake and Amir's Get Together Project

Playing charades. Jake gestures a film. 

AMIR: Film. Two words. 

JAKE: Right. 

AMIR: Titanic. 

JAKE: You just said two words. 

AMIR: The Titanic. 

JAKE: Not a movie. 

AMIR: Alright, my turn. 

Amir gestures a film. 

JAKE: Film.

Amir holds all his fingers up. 

JAKE: What film is 10 words long? .... 10th word. Fish?  

Amir shrugs his shoulders in surprise. 

JAKE: Don't... ugh.. so you're surprised? You were going like this, it's clearly a fish. Alright, I give up... 

BUS STRANGER #1: It's "Don't be a menace to South Central while drinking your juice in the hood"

AMIR: Yes. Nailed it!

They high five. 

That's like 50 words. 

AMIR: 12, actually. 

The bus applauds. 

JAKE: Don't applaud... ok? He said it was ten. 

AMIR: (to camera) Who says people can't talk to each other on the way to work? I mean, we got this bus cooking. Cooking on charades. 

JAKE: What does that mean, man? Cooking on charades... 

AMIR: Bringing the mood down, man. Not cool. 

JAKE: We wanna see you make your commute a wonderful thing. 

AMIR: Alright, give me one more. 

JAKE: Ok, fine, but it's going to be a book. 

AMIR: Nah, forget it. 

JAKE: Come on, man. 

AMIR: I already said forget it!
