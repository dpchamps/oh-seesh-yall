Jake: Are you deflating?

Amir: No.

Jake: If you're about to cry, which it looks like you are, I'm sorry I called you an idiot, alright?. You just baked or bought me a pie for seemingly no reason and I thought it was as stupid thing to do. You don't need to tick like that, if you have to cry, just let it out. Don't hold it back.

Amir: Fi-ugh. 

Jake: You're fine. So I can say that you're the worst laser tag player ever.

Amir: Gu.

Jake: Oh my god, do you see that pillar of smoke behind you? A McDonald's is burning down!

Amir: Nerrr.

Jake: How about this. Just say a sentence. If you're going to cry, say 'Jake, I'm not going to cry.'

Amir: Hey Jake! I'm not gunna CRUHHHHHH
