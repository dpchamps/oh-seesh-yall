Sarah: Hi!

Maureen: Hi, Sarah, nice to meet you.

Sarah: Nice to meet you.

Jake: This is Jeff. 

Maureen: Hi Jeff, nice to meet you.

Jake: And Streeter.

Streeter: Hi.

Maureen: Hey, Streeter.

Streeter: How are you doing?

Maureen: I've heard about you. 

Amir: (laughs)

Jake: I'll show you the rest of the office.

Amir: Streeter is so retarded.

Jake: This is my friend, Dan.

Dan: Nice to meet you.

Amir (comes out from hiding, shirtless): I'm Dan, too.

Dan: Uh, what do you think...

Amir: (knocks headphones off desk) Wow.

Maureen (talking to Dan): I'm visiting to next week, and...

Amir: Do they do this in Germany? (tries jumping a blanket, falls)

Dan: (making small talk with Maureen)

Amir: Oooh, fuuuuuuu. (trying to get off floor)

Dan: Is Jake showing you around, or...

Maureen: He's showing me around, where everyone is.

Dan: It's a nice place.

Amir (on floor): Little help!

Jake: Well, you wanna grab lunch or something?

Maureen: Sounds great.

Amir: (hits head on cabinet) Huh! Ahhhhh! Fuck! Ow. (speaks in incomprehensible slurs, implying he has brain damage)

Amir: Whooh! (falls to floor) Ahh.
