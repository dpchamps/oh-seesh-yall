Amir: All right, this is a 30 second debate between myself and Jake. Uh, Jake. What do you think about global warming? Do you think humans can slow it down or is it just an unstoppable force? Should we not even bother? Should we be like, You know what? I'm gonna drive my car and I'm gonna eat my gasoline and I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm an american?

Jake: Incoherent fast talking

Amir: I can't. I can't...let's do that again. I can't hear you when you do like fast forward talking. So just talk normal.

Jake: More fast talking

Amir: laughs You did it again. You talked..you talked like super fast, and I can't..nobody's gonna understand you.

Jake: More fast talking

Amir: laughs All right, let's just...stop it. Let's just do it later, 'cause I'm..I'm running late, so I have to go anyway. (Amir turns to leave, but as he starts walking, time slows down tremendously. Amir turns around)

Amir: Stop it! I'm seriously late! (Amir turns and leaps forward, but time has slowed again)

Amir: You're so annoying!

END

Notes:
Jake's fast talking can be understood when the video is slowed down.

First response: First of all, people don't eat gasoline. That's just a common misconception. And personally? I think we should just..let loose, you know? Drive our cars into the ozone layer. Eat garbage. Poop anywhere we want, like...the earth is fucked, and we're all going to be dead by the time global warming really takes effect, so, what's the point, right?

Second response: I..I was talking pretty normally. I didn't...really don't think I did anything..like fast forwarding? That's..what the hell does that even mean?

Third response: That's absurd. Not true at all. I don't..I'm talking [at a] very normal speed right now.
