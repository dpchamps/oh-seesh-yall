[Introduction] 

Amir: Hey, you're watching, wait for it... 

Jake: Not a lot of time. 

Amir: Wait for it- 

[Amir is sitting at his desk, a stranger (Jordan) walks in and sits at Jake's desk]

Amir: Explain. 

Jordan: Umm... (Reads from a notepad) I'm Jake. 

Amir: Umm... No you're not. laughs 

Jordan (reading from a script): Laugh (spoken). I thought you'd say that. Which is why I want to say, I am Jake. 

Amir: Okay, you're not Jake, 'cause Jake doesn't look like that. 

Jordan: That's very logical. (Reads from notepad) But have you considered this, a wizard changed my face? 

Amir: Yes, I have considered that. But have you considered this, if a wizard changed your face why did he change your voice? 

Jordan (reads from notes): Another wizard changed my voice. 

Amir: laughs and clears throat (seriously) Really? 

Jordan (reads from notes): No, got you. Laugh (spoken) Uhh... I'm wearing a mask. 

Amir: If you're Jake, then when's his birthday? 

Jordan (looking through the notes): Umm... (flips page) August 5th... Or 6th, it looks like? 

Amir: 5th... Yeah. 

(Jordan's phone rings, Jordan answers it) 

Jordan: Hey, it's Jordan... Yeah... Yeah, call me back. 

Amir: W- Why'd you say this is J- this is Jordan? 

Jordan: I... Uhh... (reads notes out loud to himself) If you mess up just tell him that best friends have to trust each other, now more than ever. 

Amir: What? 

Jordan: Best friends have to trust each other, now more than ever. 

Amir: I trust you. laughs This is crazy! What- How does it- What is- What was the wizard? 

(Jake enters) 

Amir: Whaa- Hey? 

Jake: Whoa. Hmm... I forgot this was today. Listen, this is Jake and I'm an actor that he hired. So... 

Amir: What's going on? 

Jake: This is all a dream. Everything is a dream, so its time to wake up. (Jake picks up a coffee mug and walks toward Amir) Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. (Jake hits Amir over the head with the mug) Wake up! 

Amir: Oww! 

Jake: Oh god, sorry. 

Amir: That really hurt. 

Jake: I thought you were gonna pass out or something. 

Amir: Why would I pass ou- (Jake hits amir over the head again) Hey! Come on, quit it. Alright? 

Jake: Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry. 

Jordan: Okay, I'm leaving. 

Amir (to Jordan): Jake! Wait!
