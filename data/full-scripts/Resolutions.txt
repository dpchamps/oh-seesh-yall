INTRO:

AMIR: Hey you're watching Jake and Amir and it's funnier than Mad About You.

JAKE: Mad About You?

AMIR: Yeah the TV show.

JAKE: No, I know...



[Jake is sitting on a couch reading a book (Euripides: Ten Plays). Amir is laying on the couch on his back but with his legs over the back of the couch.]

(Amir grabs Jake's book out of his hand and spins around to be sitting normally on the couch while delivering his line.)

AMIR: Ah, let's think, I've had about like nine New Year's Resolutions, and kept.. none of 'em?

JAKE: [Are] You bragging?

AMIR: Well usually I have more and keep.. none of them, so I feel like this is an improvement.

JAKE: Well percentage-wise it's still the same.

(Amir thinks, then looks puzzled and fans his face with Jake's book.)

AMIR: How do you figure?

JAKE: This is why I can't talk to you, okay? Ten seconds in, and we've hit a wall. You need a basic un--

(Amir puts his finger to Jake's lips.)

JAKE: Don't touch my lips, please--

AMIR: Talk is.. cheap.

JAKE: Okay, yeah, you ha--

AMIR: New year, new rule, you can't make fun of me--(he pukes on the floor, making a BLUUUEEAHHH sound)--if, and ONLY if,--

JAKE: No, no-w-what the fuck was that?!

AMIR: You don't make fun of me,--

JAKE: No, no, you just puked on the floor.

AMIR: (puzzled) Oohhhhkaayy?

(Jake looks at Amir, equally puzzled.)

AMIR: ...Anyway,--

JAKE: No, not anyway, you have to clean it up.

AMIR: (Sarcastic) Clean what up, my PUKE?

JAKE: ..Yeah...

AMIR: (Slight laugh.) Let's just agree to--(pukes on the floor a second time, making the same noise as before)--to disagree.

JAKE: Oh my God, you're so unheal--(Amir sneezes in Jake's face)--OAH! (pause) What the F*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?

AMIR: You're overreacting!

JAKE: I'm adequately reacting; you just sneezed puke into my face, okay, how do you want me to react?

AMIR: God bless you, for one. Okay how many times have I sneezed since you got here, man, you--

JAKE: I don't count.

AMIR: THAT'S.. your problem!

JAKE: There's puke on your chin.

AMIR: ...That's my problem.

END.
