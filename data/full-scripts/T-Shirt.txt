Amir: Ugh, It's so hot in here, I don't know how you can handle it.

Jake: I'm Pretty comfortable

Amir: I just gotta take of my sweat shirt (He removes his hoodie to show a Jake and Amir: So Ace T-shirt many sizes too small) Sup? Jake and Amir. So ace.

Jake: So Scary

Amir: Scary? Good. Got these made. Pound it brutha (Goes for fist bump and Jake taps his hand with a pen he is holding) Got one for you, so..

Jake: I wouldn't wear it. It's really really tight.

Amir: It's tight as shit, that's why I love it so much

Jake: I mean, it makes you look fat

Amir: Yep, who wouldn't look phat in a shirt this tight!

Jake: What I'm saying is that it's small

Amir: Small as shit

Jake: You know that one doesn't work, right?

Amir: Yes

Sarah: Oh, nice. Your face is on a shirt! Sweet! (High fives Amir, before mouthing wow behind his back)

Amir: Ladies love it. (Flexing) Jake. (Pushes Jake's head)
