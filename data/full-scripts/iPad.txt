AMIR: This iPad thing is crazy though. I never wanted anything more in my entire life--

JAKE: Why do you think you need one?

JAKE: What's it? What is it revolutionizing?

AMIR: It's just crazy how they made it.. it's so small.

JAKE: It's not that small.

AMIR: It's enormous.

JAKE: No. It's not--

AMIR: And that's crazy because it's weightless!

JAKE: No, it's not. 

AMIR: It's completely weightless.

JAKE: No, No.

AMIR: Yeah.

JAKE: Name one thing that it does.

AMIR: Nothing! It does everything!

JAKE: Ok, so not nothing.

JAKE: Don't say exactly and go like this (imitating Amir), like you did something smart, because you're very dumb, okay, it didn't make any--

PAT: Hey, Jake, why are you giving Amir such a hard time, man? I head you say you wanted the iPad yourself, what's up?

JAKE: Okay, yeah, I know why it's so great though.

PAT: Oh, view what?

JAKE: Shut up. Shut up, man, okay. You're putting me on the spot. (stuttering) It revolutionizes it!

PAT: Well you know what I think? (slightly laughing) I think you kinda sound like Amir at this point-- (smiling, touching Amir's shoulder)

AMIR: Okay he told you to shut up, Pat; BUTT OUT!

PAT: Whoah!

AMIR: Ok this is an A to B conversation, so C your way out of it, right? C your way out of D room.. that's right, get E-way! Get the F away! G, you're still H-ere? I don't know why, because I, J told you to K..
