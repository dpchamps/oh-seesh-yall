INTRO Jake - Hey you're watching Jake and Amir!

     Amir - Stop it! Relax! Jake, I'm you.

     Jake - Shut up.


AMIR: Hey-uh, can I talk to you for a second?

JAKE: What's up?

AMIR: Um,I  just got back from the doctor and he said that I was very sick actually.

JAKE: Really?

AMIR: Yeah, he thinks I may have March (shouting)  Madness! Fever! And pneumonia!

Amir slides his bracket across table and into frame.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Alright the bracket is a lot like the SATs. They penalize  for wrong answers. That's why I leave a lot of these blank, okay?

JAKE: What did you get on your SATs?

AMIR: 60.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: I've been crunching the numbers, Jake.

JAKE: How do you do that?

Amir looks at Jake over the top of his glasses.

JAKE: How'd you do that, I said.

AMIR: (Raises voice) Why can't you just say that's impressive?

[Jump cut]

Amir has his head turned and begins doing an impression of the Dramatic Chipmunk.

AMIR: Dun, dun, dun! Dramatic Chipmunk.

JAKE: I know.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Wow, four number one seeds in the final four. Very risky. (Amir rolls his eyes and chuckles to himself)

JAKE: I mean I could put, I was gunna put Michigan - Fuck you.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Hey, no matter what happens in this bracket, you and me, we're gunna stay friends for forever, okay? Hey look at me! (Amir gestures his two finger at his eyes.)

JAKE: Don't try to turn this into a serious moment, please.

AMIR: Nothing changes, okay?

JAKE: I know!

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Alright! So the elite 8 I have Scanson,  Portland State, blank, blank, Butler, blank.

[Jump cut]

Amir has his head turned and is doing the Dramatic Chipmunk impression again

AMIR: Dun! Dun! Du-

JAKE: (Talking over Amir) Do you have to do that, man?

AMIR: Hanh?

[Jump Cut]

AMIR: Binghamton. Duke. Binghamton is definitely gunna be upset.

JAKE: They're a fifteen seed, so.

AMIR: They're going to be upset that they lost and who wouldn't be?

[Jump cut]

Amir is laying on the table with his hands folded on his chest.

AMIR: (Sighs) Can I tell you somethin', man?

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Ah, is it too late to change my final four?

JAKE: Uh, no.

AMIR: Okay, good. I wanna make it a final six.

JAKE: Oh, it's too late to change the format of the tournament though.

AMIR: Ah sheesh. When was that due?

[Jump cut]

AMIR: (Circling his bracket) Portland state, no it's not. Cleveland state, no it's not. Utah state (looks at Jake) no it's no-

JAKE: That one's a state.

AMIR: Uh, Florida state.

JAKE: Also a state.

AMIR: Sheesh, okay. Oklahoma?

JAKE: Yeah. Ooo two for five, that sucks. You were you started out strong, though.

AMIR: I know. I was lucky. I didn't know. I was just guessing.

JAKE: I know.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: I'm thinking 74-60 blank for the tie-breaker score? (Amir repeatedly clicks his pen)

Jake shakes his head.

[Jump cut]

JAKE: Okay,  I'm done. 

Jake starts to get up from his chair.

AMIR: (Drawing large circle on his bracket) Wa-wa-wait. Where are we watching the round of 32?

Jake is walking away.

JAKE: We're not.

AMIR: (Calling out to Jake) Okay! I wanna watch my blanks, though! Blanks for the wolf! For the epic wolf.

[Jump cut]

JAKE: Also they have to, I mean they have to play these teams.

AMIR: Sure.

Jake drops his pen. Amir laughs.
