Amir: No way, no way, Jurassic Prak 2 was so underrated.

Jake: How can you say that, Jurassic Park 2 was terrible.

Amir: Not true, Jeff Goldblum was in it, which is great. And the special effects were phenomenal for the time.

Jake: Special effects? Name one good special effect in that movie.

Amir: Um, the part where the T hyphen rex attacks San Diego.

Jake: Alright, uh, yeah, I guess I'll give you that. See this is the kind of shit we should be talking about, none of this weird... go, 
take me to dinner and all that... movies.

Amir: Defiantly.

Jake: What?

Amir: Shti. Shit. Oops. Sorry. Phone's ringing. Burb. BRB.. It's my step brother, I need to take this. Stop talking. You're an idiot. 
I'm an idiot. Amir Blumenfeld is an idiot.

Jake: OK wow. Uh, I see what's going on, Patrick, why would you agree to this?

Amir: Amir said he'd pay me $1453. No, I didn't I said $1553.

Jake: OK, that's more.

Amir: Patrick you fucked me on this. No I didn't. Any retard would have stopped reading this by now. You're still reading. This is 
insane. Patrick stop. I'm still reading this, like an idiot. I'm the biggest idiot in the world. Patrick stop it. Jake will never be 
friends with me. Jake will never like me. Jake will never like me.

Jake: Patrick! Stop.
