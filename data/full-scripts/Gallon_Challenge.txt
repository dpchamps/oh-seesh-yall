INTRO: Amir (sing-song) - You are watching Jake and Amir.

Jake - Not bad.

Amir - Really?

Jake - No.



(Jake and Sarah laughing)

SARAH: This is unreal. 

JAKE: Oh my-oh! There he is! Come here, come here! 

(Amir enters)

AMIR: What?

JAKE: Did you make a youtube video? 

AMIR: (laughs) That depends. Are you impressed?

JAKE: It doesn't. That's not what it depends on at all. 

AMIR: OK, so no. I don't know-I don't know what a youtube thing is. 

SARAH: Well, my friend just sent me this link.  It's called Amir From CollegeHumor Fails Gallon Challenge. 

AMIR: That's weird. 

JAKE: Why is that weird?

AMIR: 'Cause I just failed a gallon challenge yesterday. My cousin Leron was filming it. What are the odds of that?!

JAKE: Like 100%, man.

(they all laugh some more)

AMIR: This is funny, right?

JAKE: It's embarrassing. 

AMIR: OK.

SARAH: It's like, pretty sad and very disgusting.

AMIR: I know! That's why I'm going to delete it right now.

JAKE: You can't; you didn't upload it.

AMIR: Oh. OK, so what should I do?

SARAH: You should put it on Digg.

JAKE: Yeah, yeah, you should put it on Digg.

AMIR: Yeah, I should put it on Digg. What's Digg then?

SARAH: It's like a site where people put their embarrassing videos.

JAKE: Embarrassing vi-You try and get as many people as possibly to digg it and that means like, to hide it. 

SARAH: Yeah.

AMIR: Oh. OK. So do that, woman.

SARAH: Excuse me? 

AMIR: Sorry.

SARAH: All right, well, we need a title. 

AMIR: OK. Easy.

SARAH: Umm...

AMIR (to Jake): What do you think it should be? 

JAKE: Give it something, like boring, so that less people will want to see it.

AMIR: Good idea.

SARAH: All right, what about 'Gallon Challenge Epic Fail'. 

AMIR: Epic sou-OK, that sounds like a big deal though.

SARAH: No, it's not. It's just stands for, uh, extremely placid...

JAKE: And boring.

AMIR: Oh, OK.

JAKE: He doesn't get acronyms.

SARAH: OK! Uploaded.  

AMIR: Sweet! All right, can you upload photos too? Because I've got one of Jake pi-ossing.

JAKE: N-n-n-n-n-no! 

THE END.
