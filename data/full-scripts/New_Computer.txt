Amir: New computer huh?

Jake: Yeah.

(Jake moves the new tall monitor so it blocks his line of sight to Amir. Amir cranes his neck sideways to see Jake; Jake moves the 
monitor more.)

Amir: (With his neck still sideways) Ow. (Standing up so he can see over Jake's monitor) Come on, this is ridiculous, I can't work like 
this. I can't even see my screen!

Jake: Can you just try to relax? What are you doing?

Amir: (Getting up on his desk) One second.

Jake: Come on. Amir. Just try to work like a normal person. Please.

Amir: (Sitting on his desk now) Did I tell you I found the sickest Halloween costumes for us brotha? Check it out. (Pointing to 
himself) Cornâ€”(pointing to Jake) and the cob.

Jake: You mean corn on the cob.

Amir: Is it?
