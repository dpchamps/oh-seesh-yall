[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir holds up a camera and takes a picture of Jake] 

(Jake scoffs, Amir laughs) 

Amir: I just took the funniest picture of you. 

Jake: Can you just work or something? Please. 

Amir: You're not gonna believe the face you made. (gets up and walks over to Jake) 

Jake: I'm sure I will. 

(Amir shows Jake pictures on his camera, quickly passing over many stalker-like pictures of Jake to get to the picture he just took. Jake looks distressed)

Amir: There's a lot of pictures, I had no idea. 

(Pictures of Jake at the park, on a date) 

Amir: (laughs) Sorry, that one's a video. 

(More pictures of Jake: In the bathroom, in the shower (?), naked, getting dressed, and finally at his desk) 

Amir: There. Right there. You see that? (laughs) You're like (confused) hmm? 

Jake: Yeah. No, yeah... That is good. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 

Amir: Okay. (points camera toward Jake) Which bathroom? 

Jake: Don't. 

(Amir takes a picture)
