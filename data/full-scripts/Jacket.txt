Amir (walks in, showing of jacket): Ahem.

Jake: That's new.

Amir: Yup.

Jake: Yeah, that's sharp. 

Amir: It's actually really sharp.

Jake: Yeah.

Jake (taking the coat from Amir): Here, let me get-

Amir: Woah! (chuckles) I usually don't spend so much money on myself, but...

Jake: Oh, wow. 

Amir: It fit really well.

Jake: This is mine now.

Amir: Yeah, this is mine now.

Sarah: Hey Jake, nice jacket.

Jake: Thank you. 

Amir: Nice, it's mine, though.

Jake: It's brand new.

Amir: Yeah, so, it's yours now.

Jake: Yeah.

Amir: Until... until when is it yours, then?

Jake: Forever.

Amir: Right.

Jake: It's mine. Like, it's mine now.

Amir: Oh. When will, when, when will it be mine, now?

Jake: It will not be yours now, Amir.

Amir: (snaps fingers) If I can clear that chair, it's mine.

Jake: No, it's not!

Amir: (tries jumping over a chair, falls) Ow! Oh!

Jake: Still mine then, right?

Amir: Uh, at least pay me half of what I paid.

Jake: Boom!
