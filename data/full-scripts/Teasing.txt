INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!

JAKE: Good job.

AMIR: --biiitch!

JAKE: ..Never mind.



SARAH, JAKE and PAT are sitting on a couch, laughing and smiling. PAT is holding a picture in his hands.

PAT: Yes-- so, I-- I used to be a little fat.

JAKE: (takes the picture from PAT) A little fat? C'mon man, you're a blimp in this picture. There's nothing little about it.

SARAH: (takes the picture from JAKE) I can't tell if this is a family photo or if it's just you. (JAKE lets out a laugh)

PAT: ..Alright, alright.

JAKE: More like Fat Cassels, right?

SARAH (laughing): Nice!

AMIR shows up, holding a Rubik's Cube and laughing.

PAT mumbles something, before everyone stops laughing and turn to look at AMIR.

JAKE (to AMIR): What're you laughing about?

AMIR: Same.

JAKE: Same what?

AMIR: Same same.

JAKE: Same same what?

AMIR: Same same thing that you jokesters are laughing about.

SARAH: (shows the picture to AMIR) We're laughing about this.

AMIR takes the picture.

AMIR: (looking at the picture, smiling and laughing as he speaks) Oh my jee!

JAKE: Hey, don't make fun of him too much, Pat might get mad and eat us.

Everyone laughs, except PAT.

AMIR: Hey, I'd give Pat a candy bar but he'd just eat it! (laughs) ..No, I'm just messin' with you guys. (clears throat awkwardly)

JAKE: Well, I'm gonna go back to w--

AMIR: Ww- Pat! I saw Pat eating a sandwich yesterday. Lettuce, cheese, tomato-- everything. And what he didn't finish, he just threw away. (to PAT) What's the matter Pat, ain't you ever heard of leftovers for dinner? (laughs)

SARAH (to AMIR): Are you calling him fat or wasteful?

AMIR: Whatever, it's all the same, right, tubby?

SARAH: Are you calling *me* fat?

AMIR: ..No.

AMIR (to PAT): Hey Pat, I'd give you a gift certificate to a restaurant, (to all three) but he'd probably just spend it! (laughs)

PAT: ..Yeah..

AMIR: At the restaurant, maybe. (smirks)

PAT: ..I would.

AMIR: Oh my god, this guy's too fat to even realize he's admitting it! (laughs, then makes a farting noise with his mouth) Pat farted! (quietly) No...

JAKE: Wow, that was really bad.

AMIR: What? Smelled bad maybe.

JAKE: So you did hear me.

AMIR: Yeah, smelled like food, (pointing at PAT) 'cuz that's what this guy had.. for breakfast. Gobble, gobble (acting out putting stuff into his mouth).

PAT: That's what-- (AMIR: Gobble) --That is what everyone has for breakfast.

AMIR: I KNOW. I'm messing with you, maan.

PAT: Yeah, well you're really bad at it.

AMIR: No.

SARAH: Yeah seriously Amir, don't make fun of me, I don't want anyone to know I had food for breakfast.

Everyone laughs.

AMIR (interrupting shouting over the laughing): Yeah well at least my little brother didn't die!

Everyone stops laughing.

PAT: (quietly, to himself) Ahm.. 

AMIR: ..So.

Several more seconds of silence pass.

AMIR: (quietly, with silence in between) Um. Um. No... So.

PAT pats JAKE's leg and stands up. He pats Amir on the shoulder before walking away.

PAT (sniffs, almost crying): Fine. It's funny man. Really funny.

AMIR: C'mon! I was messing with him!
