Jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. (silence) Wow, these are easier without you.



[Amir is banging some crabs with a crab mallet.]

Jake: What are you doing?

Amir: Eating lunch; is that okay? Or is it not lunchtime yet?

Jake: It's 9:30 in the morning.

Amir: Oh...

Jake: Are you eating crabs?

Amir: Crabs, lobster, shrimp, anything with a shell.

Jake: Looks like it's mostly crabs.

Amir: Turtles also have shells.

Jake: How did you get crabs?

Amir: That's how she said. (laughs)

Jake: How she said what?

Amir: A how-she says what?

Jake: You're getting further away from it.

Amir: You're a how-she.

Jake: Where did you get crabs from around here?

Amir: From a guy in front of our building.

Jake: Wow, so you bought crabs from a guy at, like, at a stand?

Amir: No, I bought crabs from, like, a guy in a truck?

Jake: Like a lunch truck...?

Amir: Like a pickup truck?

Jake: So you bought crabs from a total stranger without any concern of foodborne illnesses?

Amir: No! I bought crabs with money!

Jake: Okay, well, I think you smashed them enough, all right? You're getting pieces of shell and meat everywhere.

Amir: Okay, well, it's still alive!

Jake: Oh my god, you bought live crabs, and you brought them into the office.

Amir: What, you want me to eat these alone outside? (lifts up bag of crabs as they fall out) OH NO!

Jake: Wow, everybody tuck your pants into your socks!

Amir: Yeah, and tuck the crabs into your pants, okay? I want these babies back dead or alive! Preferably both.

Jake: How both?

Amir: One of each! Oh! (tosses mallet)

Jake: Not clever.

Amir: Clever like a cra-OWW! ONE'S GRABBING MY DIâ€”
