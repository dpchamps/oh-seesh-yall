INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I'm gonna be rich!

JAKE: Why?

AMIR: Money, honey!

JAKE: Nice.

AMIR: Okay...



[Jake is sitting on a couch. Amir joins him.]

AMIR: Good news! Gonna finally heed your advice.

JAKE: Washing your hands after you shit? Not stealing from sleeping homeless women? Holding yourself accountable, morally and professionally, for a--

AMIR: [yelling over Jake] I'm going to apply for a credit card.

JAKE: I never said that. I never said that-- do the washing your hands one.

AMIR: One step at a time.

[Amir opens his laptop. It's facing away from him.]

JAKE: Backwards computer.

AMIR: Oh, backw--...

[On the screen is nothing but an image of Jake.]

JAKE: Come on.

[Amir tries to cover the screen with his hands.]



AMIR: First thing's first: I'm the realest. [laughs]

JAKE: First thing's first is your social security number.

AMIR: Don't have one.

JAKE: I know you don't have one.

AMIR: [singing] 'Cause I'm so fancy! [speaking] Also I'm an illegal alien.

JAKE: [simultaneously] You're an illegal alien.

AMIR: Yeah.

JAKE: I already know.



AMIR: Can't wait to rack up these points!

JAKE: What do you need points for?

AMIR: Miles.

JAKE: For what?

AMIR: Trips.

JAKE: To go where?

AMIR: ...Points.

JAKE: Cool.

AMIR: Miles.

[Jake doesn't react. Amir becomes concerned.]

AMIR: ...Miles? ...Miles!

JAKE: My name's Jake.



JAKE: [reading the screen] "What's the largest purchase you've ever made?"

AMIR: Oh, actually, I spent a hundred and ten thousand Euro on a koi fish once.

JAKE: A koi fish?

AMIR: Well technically a dolphin, but it was a coy little fish. [laughs] Little bugger was playing hard to get. We actually met each other-- have you ever been to the Maldives, or Mall-dives, or whatever?

JAKE: You know what? I don't want to know anything else, about you, or the dolphins. Stop talking!



AMIR: My credit score is so low, someone once stole my identity, felt bad, and gave it back.

JAKE: Is that a tweet?

AMIR: It's a truth! ...Ruth!



AMIR: I'm actually down to open a joint checking account with you. You know I do have tens of millions of dollars.

JAKE: Okay.

AMIR: But, here's the trick: you do have to tell people about it.

JAKE: How many people?

AMIR: ...Seventy.

JAKE: No deal.

AMIR: Aah, no no no, nineteen.

JAKE: Alright, now I feel bad.

AMIR: Aah-- two!

JAKE: I feel bad.



AMIR: I'm serious, dude. My credit score is so low, I couldn't get approved for a birthday card. [tugs his collar]

JAKE: Stop roasting yourself.

AMIR: Phyllis Diller is here...



AMIR: So what you're saying is once I have this magic card, I can buy whatever I want, like a vehicle, or a three-bean salad, or a Mr. Skin Pro account?

JAKE: It's not a magic card. Yeah, you can buy whatever you want, as long as--

AMIR: I know, but I can get, like, a salami sandwich, some Silly Putty, and, let's say, I don't know, a Mr. Skin Pro account?

JAKE: Right. As long as you pay the m--

AMIR: Can I get a Mr. Skin Pro account with--

JAKE: You already have one. Look at this. You've had it for two years, and you owe a lot of money.



AMIR: My credit score is so low, Flo Rida wrote a song about it.

JAKE: "Low"?

AMIR: "Whistle"! [begins blowing air in Jake's face in an attempt to whistle]

JAKE: Your breath is so bad.



AMIR: What I'm in dire need of is actually dolphin food. Or dolphin medicine. Or...

JAKE: ...Dolphin--

AMIR: Caskets, yeah. Exactly right.

JAKE: Not what I was gonna say.

AMIR: Because you can stuff it into a human casket?

JAKE: Of course not.

AMIR: No, you can't.



AMIR: Call me Han! Because my credit score is...

JAKE: So low.

AMIR: ...out of this world!

JAKE: Bad.

[Amir coos like a pigeon. Jake cringes at his breath.]

JAKE: Really bad.



AMIR: You know, human caskets, not too terrible of an idea.

JAKE: Didn't say it.

AMIR: If you just wiggle that dorsal fin back and forth like you're peeling off a soda tab, you know, [as he mimes trying to tear off a dorsal fin] A, B, C... and then whatever letter it lands on, that girl has a crush on you?

JAKE: What do you mean, "lands on"?

AMIR: [miming ripping off the fin, making Jake wince] Like if it gets ripped off on S, you're gonna marry a Samantha...!

JAKE: You're a monster.



AMIR: Now I understand to build my credit score, I need to make my payments in a timely fashion.

JAKE: Right, so--

AMIR: Okay, and if I don't will they hack my nuts off?

[Jake doesn't respond.]

AMIR: Then I'm good.

JAKE: They're not gonna hack your nuts off--

AMIR: Then I'm good.

JAKE: --but you'll go into debt and they'll take away your possessions--

AMIR: But my nuts? Are they gonna take away my most prized possession? My family jewels? ...I'm okay then.



AMIR: Mirror, mirror, on the wa-- [hits a key] "Denied". How is that normal?

JAKE: It's very normal. It's very normal because under "Debt" you wrote "150K dolphin fee", under "Address" you wrote "Fuck off NSA", and under "Annual Income"-- I don't even know how you did this, 'cause it's a drop-down menu-- but you wrote "Flappy the dolphin is my guarantor; give me the gold card".

AMIR: [crying] I wanted the points! I wanted the points, I needed the miles, and I could have really used a trip. [closes his laptop] Least I got my nuts.

[Amir looks down. With a horrified look, he feels his lap.]

AMIR: ...Dude!
