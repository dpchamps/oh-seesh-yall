Intro:
Amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir and I made this intro.
Jake: That's a lie.
Amir: From scratch y'all.

[Sam sat at Jakes desk typing on his computer as Amir paces]

Amir: Alright, so Jakes password will be something close to his heart.

[Amir squats next to same to look at the screen]

Amir: Did you try my birthday?

Sam: I'm already in his computer.

Amir: Oh my gorsh, we're through the looking glass people.

Sam: Jake is sick today so he wanted me to email him some stuff at home.

Amir: Okay-

[Amir pushes Sams hands out of the way and takes over the computer key board]

Amir: Lets look through his chat history first. What the freckles?! This son of a beach has been talking junk about me behind my back. 

Sam: It's trash and this chat is with you.

Amir: Oh, yeah I remember now. Before I freak. He so gets me.

Sam: He called you impossibly dumb and extremely lonely.

Amir: Okay, okay. Now I feel bad. Lets try and find other dirt. Search Dirt.

[While searching dirt] Sam: Searching dirt isn't going to get us- It's jake talking dirty to his girlfriend. I can't believe that worked.

Amir: What's a beep beep beep beep beep beep beep Popsicle.

Sam: That's nowhere in this chat.

Amir: I know..i guess I was just curious. 

Sam: We shouldn't be using Jakes computer in the first place. I feel ba- He left his facebook open too?!

Amir: Oh my gorsh we are through the looking gla-

Sam: You already said that.

Amir: Let me finish!! We are through the looking glass..[picks up jakes toy dinosaur]. dinosaur..hand..so.

Sam: Smooth.

Amir: Different phrase, right?

Sam: Look at this; Jake isn't sick today, he's going on a job interview. that's shocking. You okay?

Amir: [is frozen in place Sam pushes him back and he falls.]
