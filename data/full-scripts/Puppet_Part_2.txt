RECAP Sam - previously on Jake and Amir

Amir is holding his Jake puppet. 

Amir - Hey Jake, dinner tonight? 

Jake - what are you doing? Everybody here is laughing at you, not with you.

Jake - you're the biggest loser in the whole office. 

Amir - I know. 

Jake - bitch. 

INTRO Amir - Hey... ah actually hold on a second, my shoulder hurts. 

Jake - You can still say the intro 

Amir - I SAID HOLD ON!

Jake sighs.  



Amir sneaks into Jake's bedroom. 

AMIR: Jake is going to flip his shiatsu when he realises I made a puppet of myself. Isn't that right, me? 

AMIR PUPPET: It sure is. 

Amir puppet hovers over Jake's sleeping face. 

AMIR PUPPET: HEY BEST FRIEND-AREENO. 

Jake, terrified, jumps out of bed and slumps in front of the wall clutching his duvet. 

JAKE: OH GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T KILL ME PLEASE!  

AMIR PUPPET: What's wrong?

JAKE: Oh god, I so don't want to die. 

AMIR: Hey, what's wrong? Look, it's me. 

Jake rambles. 

AMIR: It's just me, I'm not going to take anything away from you. Look, look, look - 

JAKE: Just put the puppet down. 

AMIR: Ok, look, I'm putting it down, I'm putting the puppet down. 

JAKE: NOT ON THE FUCKING BED!

AMIR: OK! Hey! Hey! I'm putting it down, I'm putting it down. 

JAKE: It's just, it's puppets, I just, it's just... 

AMIR: You're ok, you're ok, you're ok. 

Jake's living room. 

AMIR: Hey, sorry about that. 

JAKE: It's fine, I just have a fear of puppets, that's all. 

AMIR: Oh. Ok, that's... weird... heh. 

JAKE: Yeah... um, look just please don't tell anyone at work. 

AMIR: No, I'm not. Come on, I'm not going to tell anyone at work. As long as you do me a favour. 

JAKE: What? 

Back at the office. A crowd gathers around both Jake, holding an Amir puppet, and Amir, holding a Jake puppet. 

JAKE PUPPET: Hey Amir, who's your bestest friend in the whole world? 

AMIR PUPPET (half-heartedly): You. 

JAKE PUPPET: What? I can't hear you unless you do the voice. 

AMIR PUPPET: YOU. 

The crowd laughs. 

JAKE PUPPET: Actually, this is a huge step for Jake. You see, he has a crippling fear of puppets. 

The crowd laughs. 

AMIR PUPPET: What are you doing?   

JAKE PUPPET: Basically, I went over the other night with these two things and he started hyperventilating and crying like a little baby. 

The crowd laughs. 

JAKE PUPPET: Hey Jake! You're the biggest loser in the whole office! Bitch!

The crowd laughs, especially Josh.
