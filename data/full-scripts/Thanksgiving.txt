(Jake and Amir talking over Skype)

Amir: Happy Thanksgiving, Brohoom! (chuckles)

Jake: Sup?

Amir: Not much. Woah, you're not wearing a shirt?

Jake: No. Sometimes when I'm at home, I don't wear a shirt. 

Amir: Pretty, pretty chill. One, actually, one second, ok?

Jake: Don't, just-

Amir: Something is messing up... right... here. (Amir ends Skype)

Jake: I can see you moving the mouse.

Amir: (takes shirt off and recalls Jake on Skype) (grunts) Much better.

Jake: Ok. Much worse. 

(Jake puts sweatshirt on as Amir is making a weird face)

Jake: What are you doing?

Amir: I don't know. Dinner tonight? 

Jake: No, I have Thanksgiving dinner with my family.

Amir: Our family, brotha.

Jake: MY family. 

Amir: Same difference. Pound it! (puts fist up to screen with JAIK written on his knuckles)

Jake: You know that's backwards, right?

Amir: Hold it up to a mirror or something.

Jake: And spelled wrong. 

Amir: Can't help that, then.

Jake: Ok. Closing this, then. (shuts laptop)

Amir: No! (calls Jake on phone) Uh, we actually, accidentally got miscommnunicado, brotha. Hello?
