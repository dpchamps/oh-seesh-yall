AMIR: Jake. (rapping) Q-Q quick question. I hope you don't mind that I mention that.

(pause)

JAKE: Mention that what?

AMIR: I don't know, you usually, like, cut me off or tell me to shut up after two lines so I don't plan my freestyles that long.

JAKE: Yeah, you don't plan freestyles.

AMIR: Yes. I. Do. What, you want me to come up with it off the top of my head?

JAKE: No.

AMIR: You know, I think we talk to each other too much.

JAKE: Yeah. I agree.

AMIR: Which is why, I've been working, like you told me to, on a secret code language that we can use. You know, just between us. That way we can talk to each other faster but just as much.

JAKE: Right, right. I told you to work on the vide-

AMIR: Anyway, let's get started. L-G-S is let's get started so if I say that, that's what I mean.

JAKE: Alright, so you sat down, you got to work, and you just, you thought of just taking the first letter-

AMIR: And it just took me ten Ms, relax.

JAKE: Even taking ten minutes to do that, though, is kinda pathetic.

AMIR: Oh, no no no. (laughs) M means day. So, it's, a little bit more convoluted than you thought.

JAKE: Yeah, oh my God.

AMIR: You mean O-M-R.

JAKE: No, I don't.

AMIR: Jake.

JAKE: Don't.

AMIR: Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't change your name, it's perfect.

JAKE: Ew.

AMIR: D-T?

JAKE: Dinner tonight?

AMIR: Yes. Yes!

JAKE: Ok, no. You know I wasn't. I would never ask you to dinner.

AMIR: (runs off and jumps, tripping on chair) Too late, you promised, I'll meet you there. Ah!
