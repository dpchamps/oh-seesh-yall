(Amir is in the living room with a group of folks working on a jigsaw puzzle)

GIRL: Oh hey, do you want to put this one there?

AMIR: Yeah. (throws piece at table) I don't know how puzzles work. 

(everyone laughs, Jake enters)

JAKE: Amir. Can I talk to you in the kitchen, please?

AMIR: Yeah.

(in kitchen)

JAKE: QQ, ass-fuck. What time did I tell you to wake me up?

AMIR: 12:30?

JAKE: 11:30. What time is it now?

AMIR: 5:30.

JAKE: (removing robe, showing his all-over burn) It's 6:30.

AMIR: Yikes! 

JAKE: Look at me. 

AMIR: You got some color. 

JAKE: Yeah, red. I'm burnt to a crisp!

(Amir is poking at him) 

JAKE: Ow!

AMIR: Well, I mean red is technically a color. Besides, this might be one of those good problems to have. 

JAKE: Not knowing what supermodel to date would be a good problem to have. This sucks!

AMIR: I'm listening. 

JAKE: That's it. I'm done talking. You've single-handedly ruined my vacation on the first day we're here. 

AMIR: You know, Diana told me to stick up for myself against you. 

JAKE: What is that supposed to mea--

(Amir slaps him)

JAKE: OW! Fuck you. I'm done talking to you. 

(Amir slaps his back, Jake falls, the camera is back on the people working on the puzzle)

JAKE: OW! God damn it! What is wrong with you?! I fucking hate you!

GIRL#2: I'm looking for a white piece with a little bit of tree. 

(Amir is seen slapping Jake with a fly swatter, then it's back to the puzzle people)

JAKE: Is nobody seeing this?! 

GIRL: Ooo, can nay help you there, sistah. 

THE END.
