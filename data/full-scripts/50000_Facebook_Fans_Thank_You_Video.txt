[Jake and Amir side by side in front of a webcam]
Jake: Hey everybody. We just wanted to say thank you and tell you how awesome it is that we got to 50,000 Facebook fans.
Amir: 50,000! That's un- Me and Jake were just talking about how we don't even know what 50,000 is, and now we have that many-
Jake (interrupting Amir): I know what- I know what 50,000 is.
Amir: I know, yeah yeah yeah. But I'm just sayin' you- we can't even quantify that number. It's so big.
Jake: I know what- I know what you were saying. We can quantify it.
Amir: yeah. Okay, so... I'm gonna stop the video then, 'cause it's turning into a public shaming of me, and I just wanted- It started off as a sincere apology and now it's not. So I'm just gonna stop it. So, thanks for that... (in his high-pitched voice) Thanks for that.
Jake: Do you know how to stop it?
Amir: Yes! I know how to stop it.
Jake: mumbles
Amir: Yeah. I got it I got it I got it.
Jake: It's just 'cause your cursor is far above it.
Amir: Boom... no... okay...
Jake: I got it. (Jake stops the recording)
