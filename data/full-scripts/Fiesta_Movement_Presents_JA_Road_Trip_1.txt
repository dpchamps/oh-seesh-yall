AMIR: I'm sorry, let me get this straight. You want Jake and I to drive your Ford Fiesta into the river, swim back to shore and have a pizza party? I mean--

JAKE: How did you get that from what she said?

AMIR: What did she-what did--?

JAKE: OK, we're driving the Ford Fiesta around the country, we're going to tweet clues about what different cities we're in, and the first two people to find us, we're going to take them out to dinner. 

AMIR: Oh, is that--?

JILL: Exactly.

JAKE: Pretty simple.

AMIR: OK, gotcha. And you're f-you're fine with me and Jake just stealing your car for a week? 

JILL: No, I'm coming with. 

AMIR: OK, yeah. She coming with. (chuckles)

JAKE: She- Yeah, she is. 

AMIR: She is. She is. OK, gotcha. HOLY CRAP, what's that?! (dashes to the driver's side car, but the door is locked, pulls on the handle frantically for a bit then lets go) Are we ready? Let's go. All three of us, I decided that--

JAKE: She's got the keys.

AMIR: She has the keys.

(in the car)

AMIR: This is actually going to be really fun. Oh my-Jill, is that your apartment? Right there. Look look, it's on fire!

JILL: Oh my god, oh my god! (she exits the car)

AMIR: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Quickly!

JAKE: No it's not, it's fine. 

AMIR: No it's not, what are you, crazy? (to Jill, as he switches from the back seat to the driver's seat) I'm going to call 911! Oh my gosh, keep running! Run, run, run!

JAKE: What are you doing? What are you doing?!

AMIR: Let's get the hell out of here. 

JAKE: No! No, no, no, no.  

AMIR: Trust me. 

JAKE: Oh god. No. Amir.

AMIR: It's fine. It's fine! Hey, do you trust me?

JAKE: No, I don't.

AMIR: Then let's get out of here.

JAKE: I said I don't.
