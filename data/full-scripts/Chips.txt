Jake And Amir: Chips

From the Vimeo days - no intro. 

[Jake picks up a bag of Lay's chips to open them.]

Amir: Ahhh, just give me that to me. It's so annoying watching you fumble with that bag. I can open it in a second.

Jake: Okay, no.

Amir: Give it to me or I'm going to ARGHHH-

[Jake tosses the bag across the desk to Amir.]

Amir: Hizzzonkey 

Jake: Please speak in English. It's really annoying when I have to decipher your stupid language. 

Amir: Watch un larn.

Jake: See like that.

[Amir takes out a pair of scissors and cuts the through the bag and chips.]

Jake: Alright that's cheating. Come on. 

[Amir continues cutting the chips.]

Jake: And now you owe me a bag of chips. Great. Good job.

Amir: Yeesh. Crumbs. Let's just agra to disagra. 

[Amir eats a chip.]

Jake: I'd- I'd just rather it's complete gibberish so that I can just zone you out entirely. 

[Amir holds up a 'shock 'em' foam hand.]

Amir: Isn't it shocking that.

Jake: That what?

Amir: Isn't it...

Jake: That you couldn't finish the joke? No, it's not. Do you even know what that means? 

Amir: Two in the pussy and the pinky is in the asshole. 

Jake: Eughhh. I shouldn't have asked. I shouldn't have asked. 

Amir: You rang?

Jake: No, I didn't ring you. I don't ring you. Do you even know what it says  when you call me? Call me right now.

[Jake's phone rings. He shows the caller ID, which is photo of Amir with 
a banned symbol across his face.]

Jake: I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I do want to.

Amir: Muhmuhmuh my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard-

Jake: Stop 

[Amir eats another chip.]

CUT TO 

[Amir falls out of his chair. Jake looks at Amir and then gets up and leaves.]
