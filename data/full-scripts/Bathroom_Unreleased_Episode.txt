[Amir is on his cell phone, walking out of the bathroom.]

AMIR: No, fuck no- (he runs into Jake, who is just entering) ahh, yeea actually let me call you back in two seconds, bye. (flips his phone shut.) So annoying. Wazzap?

JAKE: (trying to get past Amir) 'Scuse me.

AMIR: (blocking Jake from entering) 'Scuse me? Ooh! (laughs). I have to pee again.

JAKE: Don't.

AMIR: (walking backwards toward the stalls) Meet me in the left stall, cross swords, 3-2-1 BREAK!

(Amir turns and runs into the stall and closes the door. The camera pans over to the bathroom door, which has just closed, meaning Jake has left. Amir peeks his head out over the stall door.)

AMIR: Jake!

END.
