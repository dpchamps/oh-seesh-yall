AMIR: Jake, what is your favorite type of banana and where--

JAKE: (sighs) Come on, I don't have time for this, all right? I'm leaving.

AMIR: Where are you going?

JAKE: . . . uh . . . downstairs, for a couple of seconds. 

AMIR: OK . . . I'm coming with you.

JAKE: OK, you're not. Just relax. I'll be back in a few - in a minute, one minute. (to the office) Bye, everybody. Have a good weekend.



(Amir talking to camera)

AMIR: Something was very fishy about that and I intend to find out.

PAT: Amir! You coming to the meeting? 

AMIR: Uh, yes. One second.

PAT: OK. 

(Amir runs off)



(shots of Jake working his way through the airport, Amir commentating) 

AMIR: Stairway to heaven, Jake-y? 



AMIR: You JetBlue it. 



AMIR: Get out of the way! 



AMIR: Let's see what's behind the door! (alarm goes off) I am so sorry, I think I messed up. 



(Amir filming himself in airplane bathroom)

AMIR: Jake is going to flip his shiatsu when he realizes that I am his April Fool's present.  Uh, I'm going to try and get a good look at him when I walk by, hopefully he's asleep or something. 

(Amir exits bathroom and walks past Jake on plane) 



(In LA airport, filming Jake approaching)

AMIR: Aww, here he comes! (laughs) Let's see how long until he notices me. (laughing) Oh my god, oh this is so good! Look at this, look at this. Welcome to wherever we are, brotha. Oh my god. Happy April Fools Day. Jake, it's me. I haven't seen this much happiness since me, right now. 

JAKE: Put the camera down. Turn the camera off. What are you doing in LA? How did you get here?

AMIR: Let me answer your question with another question. What's LA? 

JAKE: So you followed me onto the plane. Where's your stuff? 

AMIR: What stuff? What are you talking about? 

JAKE: Where are you staying?! 

AMIR: With you? I don't know.

JAKE: Listen. Absolutely not.



(camera zooms out on Amir lying in bed next to Jake) 

AMIR: Whoa! Ha! Your aunt is really nice. 

JAKE: You shouldn't have yelled at her. 

AMIR: OK. She wanted me to sleep in a different room.

JAKE: So did I. 

AMIR: (scoffs)

JAKE: Will you at least sleep head to toe? 

AMIR: How about - no.

JAKE: (sighs) Oh god, turn off the light then.

AMIR: Double no. And now I'm pissed at you. 

THE END.
