Intro:

Amir: Hey Evan, you're watching Jake and Amir!

Jake: Great, one for Evan.

A: Now for everyone else.

(Amir walks in, badly sunburned and wearing stereotypical Mexican clothing)

A: Hola.

J: Hey. How was Mexico?

A: Como está, como está.

J: Okay.

A: Que?

J: Nothing.

A: What did I miss?

J: A lot of work. You didn't email and tell anybody that you were leaving.

A: Porque.

J: I don't know. What'd you do down there?

A: I spent nine days getting the lay of the land. Then on the tenth day I left my hotel room and got badly... badly lost.

J: Wow, is that were you got that terrible sunburn?

A(singing): Como una promesa, eres tu! ERES TU!

J: It looks like it really hurts.

A: It hurt more yesterday, yes. My entire face was in a blister.

J: So you picked up a little bit of an accent then.

A: Yes, just a small, small leetle bit of an accent.

J: Little bit of an Italian accent and no Spanish-

A: I was lost for many moons, and many suns.

J: You were gone longer than eight days.

A: Yes, 17 moons, and oddly 21 suns.

J: That's not possible.

A: Well maybe I missed some moons, yeah.

J: You probably missed some moons.

A: Yeah, cause I fall asleep at nighttime.

J: Right.

A: Do you want your souvenir or not, I had to smuggle it.

J: Okay then no!

A: Let me just pass it through me, sanitize it, and give it back to you.

J: So it's in your butt right now.

A: Sí. Sí señor.

J: Is that why you're so unbelievably calm?

A: Yes. 

J: And you won't sit down? 

A: I cannot sit down it hurts too much.

J: Because you have a souvenir inside your anus.

A: Sí sí yes.

J: What'd you get me?

A: I got you a real authentican Mexican sombrero.

J: Okay, let's get you to a doctor.

A: Ah sí, actually don't touch me because it's EXPANDING IN ME! Ohh-
