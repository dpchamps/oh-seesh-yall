[INTRO] 

Amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir... even though the old videos used to be funnier. Why don't you just watch the old videos?

Jake: [overlapping] Wow! Stop!



Amir: [dressed in full mime costume] Hey, can I ask you a question?

Jake: Mimes can't talk.

Amir: [yelling] Can I ask you a question?!

Jake: What?

Amir: It was about if mimes can talk. But you already answered it so, wow -- that was hard.

Jake: So, why'd you yell at me still?

Amir: [pantomiming zipping his mouth closed and throwing the key into a body of water, with the key sinking to the bottom]

Amir: [pantomiming being trapped behind a wall -- then unexpectedly screaming]

Jake: No noise!

Amir: I'm starting to really regret dressing up as a mime.

Jake: Now you're starting to regret it?! Not when people threw coins at you on the subway? Or when Ricky called you into his office and said you have to take this job more seriously? How about when you spent 45 minutes outside in the snow because the secruity guard wouldn't let you into our building -- how did you feel then?

Amir: [pantomiming crying]

Jake: See, that's good. You don't say anything.

Amir: [pantomiming climbing up a ladder with ease] Not saying anything...

Jake: Exactly.

Amir: [pantomiming being trapped behind a wall again] Zero. Audio. Output.

Jake: Completely silent.

Amir: [pantomiming struggling to climb up a ladder] Completely... silent... not... a peep... from me--

Jake: [interrupting] You're peeping! You're talking right now.

Amir: Well, that's because you're not giving me any feedback!

Jake: I was giving you feedback. Just shhh.

Amir: [pantomiming being trapped behind a wall again] 

Jake: That's good...

Amir: You're not just saying that?

Jake: No. Just be quiet...

Amir: You really mean that?

Jake: [exploding] You know what?! Alright, you really suck at this! Why don't you just go wash the face paint off!

Amir: It's called spray paint.

Jake: Wow. You shouldn't have spray painted your face -- how did you do your lips?

Amir: Like Binaca, okay? You form a wall with your tongue and go [pantomiming spraying at his open mouth) khh, khh, khh, and hope for the best.

Jake: Oh my God...

Amir: Hey, does everything taste like lead to you, or is that just a mime thing?
