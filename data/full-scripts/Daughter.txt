INTRO Amir - Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. 

Jake - Hey, you're drooling a little. 

Amir - A little bit. 

Jake - Actually a lot. 

Amir - Yeah. 



(Emily is sat by Amir at his desk, Jake approaches his desk) 

EMILY: I need some more money.

AMIR: I know.

EMILY: Like--

AMIR: Yeah. Yes, yes. (to Jake) Oh, Jake! (chuckles) Emily meet Jake, Jake meet my daughter, Emily. 

JAKE: OK, I'm going to work from home today. (calling out) If anybody needs me, I'm going to be on e-mail and Facebook chat. 

AMIR: Hey, hey, hey, hey. My daughter came in today. Do us the courtesy. 

JAKE: OK, Emily it's nice to meet you and I'm sorry, no offense, but I just don't want to--

AMIR: Yo, yo bro. Eyes up here, OK? She's underage. 

JAKE: I was looking at you. 

AMIR: Yeah, well she's nineteen so.

JAKE: OK, well then she's not underage. 

AMIR: She's under your age. She's under your age.

JAKE: That's not what that means though. 

AMIR: You pervert, justifying it to me like I'm a judge. 

JAKE: Shut up! How do you have a nineteen year old daughter? 

AMIR: Trust me. You don't want to know. (chuckles)

JAKE: You know what? You're probably right. So I actually don't--

AMIR: I walked into a sperm bank when I was nine--

(over Amir)

JAKE: I thought we just agreed that we're going to--

AMIR: --ready to go 'cause, 'cause--

JAKE: --No! 

AMIR: --cause I was strapped--

JAKE: Stop talking!

AMIR: 'cause--

JAKE: I don't want to know. 

AMIR: I was strapped for cash. (just Amir) And my illegal guardian was being a douche. 

JAKE: They cannot possibly allow a nine year old to donate sperm.

AMIR: They don't. That's why I tried to adopt this dumb-ass orphan on a whim. Ready for the rub?

JAKE: No! You know what? I'm not. And by the way, I just looked it up on my work calendar on my phone, it's not Bring-Your-Daughter-To-Work Day. 

AMIR: I'm trying to get her a freaking externship, OK? Do you realize how hard that is? Sorry for caring.

JAKE: You don't care. You just called her a dumb-ass orphan to her face. 

AMIR: So anyway, I tried to adopt this dumb-ass orphan--

JAKE: Again.

AMIR: --but they wouldn't let nine year olds do that either. 

JAKE: So how is she your daughter?

AMIR: I just met her at the freaking mall outside of a Hotdog-On-A-Stick and she called me 'daddy', demanding that I buy her lunch and take her and her friends on a six day shopping spree.  

JAKE: Gotcha, so she's not your daughter, she's a con-artist. 

EMILY: Wait, you keep your work calendar on your phone? 

JAKE: Yeah. 

EMILY: What a dork! 

(they laugh)

AMIR: Emily go to your room! (Emily gets up to leave) Sorry about that, I shouldn't have yelled. (hands her money) Go get yourself a Jamba Juice, can I have a peanut butter mood, please? Thank you. (Emily exits) She is a burden but she means well. 

JAKE: No, she doesn't. 

AMIR: Talk about my daughter again like that and I will end you. I will break your neck!

STREETER: (with a funny accent) Oh, oh, oh! Who's talking about my niece like that?!

AMIR: Jake.

JAKE: You guys aren't brothers. 

STREETER: I'LL BREAK YOUR F**KING NECK! 

AMIR: He'll break your neck.

JAKE: (to Streeter) Why are you talking like that? 

AMIR: 'Cause your neck is broken, my friend. 

STREETER: Already broken. 

AMIR: It's already broken--

JAKE: What are you talking about? 

AMIR: When your neck is broken, you hear accents. 

JAKE: You hear his accent. 

AMIR: I hear his accent because my neck it broken. I broke it on the way to work today. 

THE END.
