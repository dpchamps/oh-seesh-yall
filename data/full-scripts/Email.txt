INTRO: Amir - Hi, you're watching Jake and Amir and I'm high as fudge.

Jake - What did you smoke?

Amir - Nothing.



(Amir is holding a game controller, appearing to play a video-game) 

AMIR: Freak.

JAKE: Hey, Amir? What are you doing?

AMIR: Uh, one second. I'm just WRITING-Ugh, (wrapping cord around controller) I was writing an e-mail but now I'm dead, so. 

JAKE: You're dead?

AMIR: Oh. I'm dea..what? Why? What?

JAKE: You're acting like you didn't say you were dead?

AMIR: N-n-no.

JAKE: You're terrible at being discreet while you are obviously playing a video game. 

AMIR (back to playing): Yeah, I don't even know what that means, so how could I be doing it? 

JAKE: You do a lot of stuff your vocabulary isn't capable of describing, but that doesn't mean it's not happening. 

AMIR: One second.

JAKE: For instance: you don't know what malnourished means. 

AMIR: Correct.

JAKE: But, you eat a diet only of chicken nuggets. 

AMIR (distressed): Can you just shut your pretty mouth and beat this e-mail for me? 

JAKE: I'll tell you what. I'll take you out to dinner if you just make eye contact with me for 5 seconds. 

AMIR: One. (glaces down and back) Two-three-four. (glances down and back) Five. 

JAKE: Five second in a row. 

AMIR: OK, you didn't say that. You have to specify, right?

(Jake takes off show and removes sock to throw at Amir)

JAKE: All right. Catch. (throws sock)

(Amir catches sock in his mouth) 

JAKE: Show me your hands.

AMIR (spits out sock): I'll show you one hand, how's that? And then, when I'm done with that, I'll show you my other hand.  

JAKE: OK.

(Amir raises hand with controller in it)

JAKE: Ooo, you messed up. 

AMIR: (sighs) Dang it. 

(blackout)

(Jake is sat next to Amir as he plays)

JAKE: You know that this is a youtube video right?

AMIR: One second, hardest part, coming right up. Right here.

JAKE: So no. 

THE END.
