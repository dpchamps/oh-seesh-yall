INTRO

JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.  This one's for all the pretty girls out there.

AMIR: Creep.

JAKE: What?



(Jake and Amir are at a bar for the entire episode)

AMIR: Feels kinda weird.

JAKE: Don't worry about it, man.  Hooking up with babes is like second nature to me.

AMIR: I know, I just, I haven't kissed anybody since you killed my girlfriend.

JAKE: Drop it, okay?  You can't poison tonight with your negative energy.



JAKE: (to GIRL #1)  You know, I always said a woman's place was in the kitchen...as the head chef...at a 5-star restaurant.

GIRL #1: Idiot. (walks away)

AMIR: (to GIRL #1 as she walks away) You heard him!  Get back in the kitchen, ya idiot!

JAKE: No, no



AMIR: (to GIRL #2) Hey girl, are you Enterprise?  Cuz I'll pick you up.

(GIRL #2 laughs)

(Amir tries to pick her up from her legs and she screams and falls back and hits the ground.  She starts moaning.)

AMIR: More like Hertz, I guess.

JAKE: Call an ambulance.

AMIR: I will!



JAKE: (Talking about a girl off-screen to his right) Hey dude, 3 o'clock.

AMIR: Oh yeah? am or pm?

JAKE: Doesn't matter.

AMIR: Well, analog or digital?  Cuz I can't read analog.

JAKE: You know, then it really doesn't matter.

AMIR: Well, is it the hour hand or the minute hand?

JAKE: Just, forget it.

AMIR: Very cool!

JAKE: It's to the right.

(Amir turns left)

JAKE: Other right.

(Amir turns left again)

JAKE: Wow!

(Amir keeps turning until he faces the direction the girl off-screen was in)

AMIR: Oh. She is hot.

JAKE: She's gone.

AMIR: Ooh yeah, she is...gone!

JAKE: Leave the bar, buddy.

AMIR: Absolutely.

(Amir starts walking)

JAKE: Door's the other way.

(Amir turns around and starts walking)

AMIR: OHMYGOD I'm an idiot!



(GIRL #1 that Amir made fall is on the bar.)

BARTENDER: (on the phone)  She's not conscious but she's breathing, yeah.

AMIR: (Yelling to people off-screen and pointing to the unconscious girl) Hey, body shots!



AMIR: (to GIRL # 3) Excuse me, are you a Capital One card?  Cuz, what's in YOUR wallet?

(GIRL #3 walks away, disgusted) 

JAKE: Nice.

AMIR: She must not watch commercials.  That's not on me.  It's a product of the DVR culture that we live in!



JAKE: (to GIRL #4) Hey...I made a bet with my friend here.

GIRL #4: What's the bet?

AMIR: Fuck if I know.

JAKE: He bet me I couldn't talk to the prettiest girl here - 

AMIR: Oh, I most certainly did not, I do not wager.

JAKE: shhh - and get her number.

AMIR: Bull shite!

GIRL #4: I'm gonna go.

(GIRL #4 walks away)

AMIR: (to GIRL #4 as she walks away) Please do!  This entire conversation is based on a false premise! (to Jake) Woah...swing and a diss.  Heh heh.  Was that wager for real, though?  Cuz if so, you owe me a G.



AMIR: (to GIRL #5) Girl, are you a Volkswagon?  Cuz, drivers wanted!

(GIRL #5 walks away)

AMIR: (to GIRL #5 as she walks away) Wow...another DVR girl...(shouting after girl) you can't fast forward through life!



(GIRL #6 is the same girl that Jake hit on in line in the episode Club)

GIRL #6: So...I will make out with you.  

JAKE: Awesome.

GIRL #6: Keep in mind, I will not like it!  

JAKE: Fine. Fine.

GIRL #6: AND you have to put your wallet in this jar of pickles.

JAKE: Oh wow, I'll just cancel my credit cards.  Bet you didn't think of that, dumb ass.

(Jake puts his wallet in the jar of pickles)

GIRL #6: AND your Iphone.

JAKE: Whew...you know what, that's almost a deal-breaker.  Oh, wait, no it's not!

(Jake dips the Iphone in the jar of pickles)

GIRL #6: Submerge it.

JAKE: Submerge it for second base.

GIRL #6: Okay, submerge it, and I'll let you kiss my hand.

(Jake lets the Iphone fall, and kisses Girl #6's hand)

JAKE: Worth it!

(Jake high-fives Amir and laughs a little)

JAKE: I hooked up!  I hooked up!



JAKE: Barkeep, come on, I need a bag of rice, stat!  I have to get my phone in rice in the next two minutes or she's a goner.  I know, cuz I've lost 6 other Iphones to that cruel mistress.

(to GIRL #7)

JAKE: Hey, if you think this is sad, you should read my diary.  Every single day reads like a fucking suicide note.

GIRL #7: Me too.  

JAKE: Yeeesh. Hey, I'm engaged, sweetheart.



AMIR: (to GIRL #8 and GIRL #9) Hey, who do you ladies think is better looking?  Me, or my boy over here.

JAKE: No, sorry, you know what?  Don't answer that.  Cuz either you guys are gonna tell the truth and hurt HIS feelings, or lie and hurt mine.

GIRL #8: It's him [Amir].  And I'm not lying.

JAKE:  Congratulations, friend, what's your name? What's your number?

(Silence)

JAKE: You know what, you have the least popular opinion in the bar.

GIRL #8 (to GIRL #9):  Who do you think is better looking?

GIRL #9: Glasses. [Amir]

JAKE: Yeah, fucking right!  How so??  How so??

AMIR: You're wrong.



JAKE: (to GIRL #6) This has been the highlight of my year.  What a ride.  Come here.

(Jake puts his arm around Girl #6's shoulders and pulls her in)

GIRL #6: Oh!

JAKE:  Can you, sorry, don't make that noise, cuz it makes me feel like shit.



(Amir walks on-screen, his shirt all orange)

AMIR: Okay, bad news bears, I think we have to go, as I was pepper sprayed just now, not once, but thrice in what I thought was a unisex bathroom.

JAKE: Don't worry, buddy.  Happens to me all the time.  (to bartender) Hey, barkeep, we need a glass of whole milk.  Okay, my friend here just had his mace cherry popped.

BARTENDER:  Yeah, you guys gotta leave.

JAKE: Okay, absolutely understandable.  I already hooked up tonight.  (to Amir) That burns your nostrils if you inhale it, dude.
