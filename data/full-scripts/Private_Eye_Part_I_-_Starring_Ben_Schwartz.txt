(AMIR is walking through the office when BEN SCHWARTZ reaches out and pulls him aside into a room. AMIR gasps.)

BEN: OK, I did everything you asked me to do, alright, I found out all the information.

AMIR: Who are you?

BEN: I'm the private eye you hired.

AMIR: No - you don't look anything like him, I'm sorry.

(BEN unbuttons his third button)

AMIR: Oh! There you are. (Laughs loudly) I didn't recognise you with your shirt like that.

BEN: I'm a master diguise.

AMIR (Quickly): Alright, so what'd you find out? 

BEN: OK, so you told me to follow Drake and find out all his likes and dislikes.

AMIR: Whoa, whoa - not his dislikes, OK? I'm not paying you for his dislikes.

(BEN grabs AMIR by the throat and pushes him against the wall.)

BEN (Yelling): YOU ARE PAYING ME FOR THE DISLIKES! OK? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

(AMIR is making a choking sound throughout. He nods when BEN finishes talking. BEN lets go of AMIR)

BEN: Jeez christ, oh mayan, oh g-

AMIR (Hurt): Aah.

BEN: Hey - if you refer me to one of your friends just to remind you don't bring up that I choked you.

AMIR: I might not be able to refer you because you do choke pe-

(BEN grabs AMIR by the crotch and lifts him up in the air. AMIR is letting out a high pitched wail)

BEN (Yelling): YOU WILL REFER ME, RIGHT?

AMIR (High pitched): Yes, I'll refer you.

BEN (Yelling): AND YOU'RE GONNA BE MY FRIEND ON LINKEDIN

AMIR (High pitched): OK, I'll be your friend on LinkedIn.

BEN (Yelling): YOU'RE GONNA BE MY BEST FRIEND ON LINKEDIN.

AMIR (High pitched): I don't know if there's a setting for-

(BEN drops AMIR)

BEN (Quickly): Aah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just get fiery hot, I gotta take my medicine.

AMIR: No-

(BEN takes out a MMs box and pours the whole lot into his mouth)

AMIR: Oh my-

(BEN makes a funny sound as he swallows the MMs)

AMIR: Is that what you think the 'M' stands for?

BEN (Mouthfull, MMs fall out his mouth as he speaks): One of them, one of them stands for medicine, I don't know what the other stands for. Maybe Maybelline, (singing loudly) MAYBE IT'S MAYBELLINE.

(BEN comes close to AMIR to whisper)

BEN: By the way, when I was feeling around on your balls, right? (Whispering) You may have testicular cancer.

AMIR: Why?

BEN: Cause you have more balls than you need man.

AMIR: I have two balls, I have two balls and that's it. That's how many you're supposed to have. You're supposed to have two.

BEN (Whispering very quietly): Can you feel my balls?

(AMIR feels BEN's testicles)

AMIR: You have one.

BEN: Fuck.

(As he says this, coloured drool falls from BEN's mouth)

AMIR: ...Yeah... Anyway, do you have like a lis-

BEN: No, stop, ssh, we can't talk about anything else, the place might be bugged, OK?.

AMIR: By who?

BEN: You wouldn't know.

(As he says this, BEN places a rag over AMIR's mouth)

BEN (Whispering over AMIR's muffled voice): Just sleep, sleep like a baby. 



(AMIR wakes up sitting on a chair in another room. He sees BEN, holding a yellow balloon with a crudely drawn face on it in front of his face. AMIR shrieks as BEN moves the balloon to and from his face.)

BEN (Taking balloon away from face): It's a balloon, it's a balloon.

(AMIR is sitting in a chair with his right hand tucked into his pants.) 

AMIR: What happened? What time is it? Where am I? What'd you do?

BEN: Time doesn't matter but let me tell you this: you could not be trusted in that other room.

AMIR: So why didn't you just ask me to leave? I would've walked out with you. Why is my hand down my pants?

BEN: Because that way you know my hand isn't down your pants, if your hand is-

AMIR: Then you'd have to put your hand down there when you put my hand down there?

BEN: Could you tip your head back real quick?

(AMIR does so.)

BEN (throwing rag over AMIR's face): ...and inhale...

(AMIR falls asleep.)



(AMIR is lying on a table, both his hands tucked into his pants. BEN climbs on top of him.)

AMIR: Oh- my gosh.

(BEN laughs)

AMIR: Why two hands?

BEN: Y2K- you remember that a couple months back? Listen, I printed out all of Drake's likes, you study those (whispering) he's gonna be best friends with you.

AMIR: K... Right.

BEN (Pulling out a piece of paper and placing it on AMIR's chest): K? All you need to do, you ready?

AMIR: Yeah...

BEN: You ready to get a new best friend?

AMIR: I'm ready...

BEN and AMIR: I'm ready to get a new best friend!

BEN: Say it with me:

BEN and AMIR: I'm ready to get a new best friend!

BEN: It's a great day!

BEN and AMIR: I'm ready to get a new best friend!

BEN: Fantastic!
    (Simultaneously)
AMIR: It's a great day...

BEN: I'm gonna go to the bathroom, OK?

AMIR: OK...

BEN: OK-

(BEN places a rag over AMIR's mouth, AMIR passes out.)
