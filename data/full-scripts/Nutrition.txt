JAKE and SARAH: (Laughing)

JAKE: Oh my god...

AMIR: I'm still here.

JAKE: (sighs)

SARAH: Let's give Amir the quiz.

JAKE: No, it's just going to be depressing.

AMIR: What kind of quiz is it?

SARAH: It's a nutrition quiz, you like put in what you eat and it tells you how long you have to live.

AMIR: (laughs) Oh wow, me and Jake took a quiz once...

JAKE: No we didn't.

AMIR:...and it told us which Sex in the City's character we were.  So don't think you're special or unique.

JAKE: Okay here you go, question one.  How often do you eat vegetables?

AMIR: Ten times a day.

SARAH: Really?  Good job.

JAKE: You don't eat vegetables ten times a day.

AMIR: Oh, I thought you said how much do you eat every day and that Vegetables was your nickname for me.

SARAH: (laughs)

JAKE: No, he's being serious.  How much fruit do you eat?

AMIR: Well is barbeque sauce a fruit, cause it's red and...

SARAH: No...

AMIR: What, er...

JAKE: Kay, she's being polite.  She meant to say, "Of course it's not, obviously, you fucking retard."

AMIR: Alright, what about fries?  Er, that's a potato, er, er apples?  Or ketchup!

SARAH: Well apples, apples are a fruit.

AMIR:  Eh, okay.  Still zero then.

JAKE: Okay, I'll skip this question about vitamins because I assume you don't know what those are.

AMIR: Thank you soul mate. 

SARAH: Alright, uh, how many times do you eat fast food in a week?

AMIR: ...Sparingly.

SARAH: Oh, that's great!

JAKE: No, watch this.  Amir, what does "sparingly" mean?

AMIR: All day, every day, every hour, got a chicken nugget in my pocket gotta put it in my mouth.

SARAH: Jesus, where did that, where did that even come from?

JAKE: He just has them.

AMIR: Hey, anyway, what's it say?  How long do I got?  Sixty years?  Two hundred years?

JAKE: Stop.

AMIR: Three hundred years?

JAKE:  According to this, you should have been dead ten years ago.

AMIR: Living on borrowed time.  Pretty chill, pretty poetic.

SARAH: Yeah, no, you should watch what you eat, Amir.

AMIR: I do watch.  I watch it go...in my mouth!

JAKE: See, you don't even do that.

AMIR: Whateva.

JAKE: Will you at least pick that up?

AMIR: Five minute rule.
