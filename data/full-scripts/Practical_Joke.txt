(Jake and Amir sitting on their chairs, leaned towards each other)

AMIR: I think you should leave.

JAKE: Ok. (Stands up and trips, because his shoelaces are tied together)

AMIR: (laughing) Hah! I tied your shoes together.

JAKE: (also laughing) Fuck you, dude...

AMIR: (suddenly getting serious): Fuck me, huh? 

JAKE: (apologetic): I'm sorry, I really-- I didn't mean anything--

AMIR: I'm trying to play a joke and Fuck you, man, that's all I get back? I'm sorry, wow. I'm a dick for playing a joke. On my friend.

JAKE: I didn't mean it like that...

AMIR: Someone I thought was my friend, at least.

JAKE: (confused)...uh...

AMIR: Why are you untying your shoes? That means the joke's over, that means our relationship's over. When you fell over, I laughed, because I respected you. How wrong I was. Shame on me.

JAKE: (while standing up) You know what, let's...  why don't we just talk about i-- (tries to sit down, but Amir pushes the chair with his leg and he falls over again)

AMIR: (while Jake is falling) I don't even wanna talk about it.

JAKE: Aah! (clearly in pain) Fun... funny!...

AMIR: Funny, right?

JAKE: (still in pain) Yeah...

AMIR: So act, act like it's funny.

JAKE: Good one... What do you want me to say, it really fucking hurt!

AMIR: And there's that effort again! You didn't... Forget it. (leaves)
