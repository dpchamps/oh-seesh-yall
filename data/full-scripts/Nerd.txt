AMIR: Jake.

JAKE: Come on, what's the rule?  Don't talk to me, unless - 

AMIR: Unless I have a question, which, I do...and that is...did you get play this weekend?  

(Jake gives Amir an incredulous look).

AMIR: Boom.  Straight up.  I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.  I respect you too much...for that.

JAKE: Play?  Did I get play?

AMIR: Did you get it?  That.  Jake.  What?  Yeah.

JAKE: Okay, new rule: No talking to me unless you have a question, SPECIFICALLY pertaining to 
work.

AMIR: Okay, new rule for you, no talking to me, unless....you want to.

JAKE: Fine.

AMIR: Or, okay, new rule...unless, even if you don't want to, I get 3 begs a day.

JAKE: Okay, stop talking.

AMIR: Wow.  Sorry.  Sorry you don't get with fine chicks.  That's not my problem, though.

JAKE: Okay, nobody calls chicks fine or says play.  THAT'S your problem.

AMIR: Oh, THAT'S my problem.

JAKE: Yeah, you're like an 8th grade nerd.

AMIR: Nerd, right?  I'm a nerd?  I'm a nerd?  I'm a nerd?  I'm a ner-hahahahahaha

JAKE: Okay, you're yelling.

AMIR: Would a nerd get oh, i don't know, a 1.26 gpa in college?

JAKE: Are you serious?

AMIR: 3 D pluses and an F.  Every trimester.   Like clocks...

JAKE:  Okay.

AMIR:  ...work.  Ask any one of my professors.  I didn't study for one exam, one quiz - 

JAKE: Okay, that's like pathetic.

AMIR: Pathetic, maybe.  But why don't you call me a nerd?

JAKE:  You're a nerd.

AMIR:  Call me a nerd one more time.

JAKE:  You're a nerd.

AMIR: Louder.

JAKE: YOU'RE A NERD!

AMIR: You'll do ANYTHING I fucking tell you to do, won't you? (Amir makes a kissing motion)

JAKE: Don't do that.

(Amir makes a hesitant, insecure kissing motion, then gives up)

AMIR:  Sorry.
