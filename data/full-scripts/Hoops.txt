INTRO

[A piece of paper reads "COLLEGEHUMOR'S ALL-NIGHTer 2014"; "TEN VIDEOS. ONE NIGHT!"]

ALL: CollegeHumor's All-Nighter!



[Jake, Pat, Elaine, and Vincent are playing Nerf basketball in the office. They are all yelling and having fun (the dialogue is indistinct). Vincent takes a shot at the net, but Amir appears and grabs the ball out of the air.]

AMIR: Ohh!

[Everybody stops.]

AMIR: Air Jordan, fuckers!

JAKE: You're not playing.

AMIR: I got winner.

JAKE: We're not keeping score.

AMIR: Y'all are a bunch of Lisa Leslies... and I'm Rebecca Lobo!

VINCENT: More like Rebecca Hobo!

[Amir throws the Nerf ball forcefully at Vincent's windpipe.]

VINCENT: [struggling to breathe] You killed me!

[Vincent falls to the floor.]

AMIR: Who else has anything to say about my personal appearance, or my persona? In fact... who here thinks I'm a persona non grata?

PAT: What does that mean?

[Amir throws another ball, which hits Pat in the forehead.]

PAT: ...I'm dead...

[Pat falls to the floor as well.]

AMIR: [procuring another ball] Looks like y'all need one more.

JAKE: Two more.

AMIR: [tossing the ball to Jake] Take it out. I'll go Jew on one.

ELAINE: Technically, it would be two on Jew.

[Amir lunges at Elaine, and Jake holds him back.]

JAKE: No. No, no. Dude.

AMIR: Let me bite her! Let me bite her!

JAKE: [shoving Amir back] Stop, dude! Stop it!

AMIR: It's clear to me what's going on. I can take a hint. Y'all don't want me here. Right?

JAKE: It's not a hint-- right! Of course not! We hate you. Leave!

AMIR: Play me for it.

JAKE: Excuse me?

AMIR: The court. Play me for it. One take. One ball. One play. Winner take all. You make it, you take it. Playground rules.

[Amir takes off his shirt. His abdomen is censored for some reason.]

JAKE: Jesus Christ.

[Vincent gets back up.]

VINCENT: You know, the swelling on my larynx is actually subsiding--

[Amir throws another ball at Vincent's throat.]

VINCENT: Not again!

[Vincent falls back to the floor.]

AMIR: [tossing yet another ball to Elaine] Come at me.

[Amir runs and punches Elaine in the face.]

AMIR: Ohhh!

ELAINE: My schnoz!

[Amir headbutts one of Jake's teeth in, and takes a shot at the net.]

AMIR: Boom, baby!

[The shot misses.]

AMIR: Wooooo!

JAKE: You missed it!

AMIR: Doesn't matter! I win!

JAKE: No you don't!

AMIR: Playground rules!

JAKE: You broke my tooth! You didn't score!

[Pat gets up.]

PAT: He has a point, Jake.

JAKE: What are you talking about? No he doesn't! Redemption shot, from way downtown!

[Jake successfully makes a shot.]

AMIR: Nah. DQ. I don't think so. Flagrant.

VINCENT: [getting up] Poor form, Jake.

JAKE: Vinny, he almost killed you!

VINCENT: It was well within the confines of the game!

JAKE: No it wasn't!

AMIR: Go home, Jake.

PAT: Yeah. Go home, Jake.

JAKE: Excuse me.

VINCENT: Yeah. Go home, Jake.

AMIR: Go home, Jake.

[Pat, Amir, Vincent, and Elaine all chant in unison.]

ALL: Go home Jake! Go home Jake! Go home Jake!

JAKE: What are you doing?

[Ben Schwartz appears, and joins in.]

JAKE: Whoa, wait, this--

[Jake begins backing toward the door. Boom mics are visible.]

ALL: Go home Jake! Go home Jake! Go home Jake!

JAKE: Relax... okay. Let me leave!

ALL: Go home Jake! Go home Jake! Go home Jake! Go home Jake!

JAKE: C'mon. Hey-- you're breaking the fourth wall! Sam's not gonna like this! Let me leave! Sam's not gonna like this!



[Jake is in Sam's office, showing him the video up until that point. Chanting can still be heard from the screen.]

SAM: I don't like this. Go home, Jake.

JAKE: Wait, what?
