INTRO:

JAKE: Hey you're watching Jake and Amir.

AMIR: Buy my cordless phone on eBay, y'all.

JAKE: What?



[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks.]

(Streeter comes over to Amir and leans on his desk.)

STREETER: Sup, man?

AMIR: Hey.

STREETER: Hey, uh, can you check with the illustrator, make sure the artwork's done for the weekend?

AMIR: Yeah, definitely.

STREETER: Awesome, thanks. (He smacks Amir on the shoulder. Amir flinches in pain.)

JAKE: Wow. You're just gonna let him talk to you like that?

AMIR: Pshh, no! I don't let anybody talk to me, like any way, ever.

JAKE: So you've never talked to anybody?

(Amir smiles, as if saying heheh. ya got me.)

JAKE: You know what I would do if I were you?

AMIR: Develop a secret handshake with me.

JAKE: I'd march right into Ricky's office, and make him choose.

AMIR: Great idea! (He gets up and starts walking to Ricky's office, smiling largely.)

JAKE: I didn't finish.

AMIR: Right. (he turns around and continues the conversation, standing up now.)

JAKE: You make him choose: you, or Streeter.

AMIR: Me. (as though Jake had asked him to choose)

JAKE: Him choose.

(Amir does the smile)

JAKE: Hey, if he even hesitates, if he's like um I don't really know, I guess you, then f*** him! You wanna work under a guy who's not SURE (bangs his fist on the table) who his favorite employee is? No, you don't! You don't deserve that! Do you think you deserve that?

AMIR: Yah! I deserve-, everything!

JAKE: No, you don't deserve that.

AMIR: You're right. I don't deserve anything.

JAKE: You deserve some stuff.

AMIR: Right. Sure.

JAKE: Okay, practice on me.

AMIR: Ricky: choose: me or Sweeter

JAKE: (correcting Amir) Streeter.

AMIR: Streeter.

JAKE: Ooh, I dunno, I guess, uh--and then you cut me off, cuz you just f***ing quit!

AMIR: (exhales) I'm ready.

JAKE: You know what man? F*** Ricky, for even making you ask the question.

AMIR: (exasperated) Okay will you just tell me what to do because I don't GET IT anymore!

JAKE: (leaning back in his chair) March your ass in there and quit!

AMIR: Done!

(The video cuts to a black screen with text that says FOUR HOURS LATER.)

[Amir is putting things from his desk into a cardboard box. Jake is leaning back in his chair, stretching his arm over his chest.]

JAKE: Hey how'd it go?

AMIR: Um... poorly. So.

JAKE: Ooogh. I'm sorry to hear that man.

AMIR: Yeah, I mean, at least I got more money out of it, plus he begged me to stay, so it's not so bad.

JAKE: Yeah well I guess I'm really--...What?

AMIR: Yeah, he said it would cost more money to like find a replacement, so he just doubled my salary. Sorry I didn't get to quit like you told me.

JAKE: Why are you putting your stuff in a box?

AMIR: (mockingly, as though it's obvious) Because I have money now, I can just buy new stuff.

(Jake looks at Amir, stunned at his stupidity.)

AMIR: Jake I'm richer than you.

Jake. (quietly) ...k...

AMIR: Call me Richard. (he does the smile)

END.
