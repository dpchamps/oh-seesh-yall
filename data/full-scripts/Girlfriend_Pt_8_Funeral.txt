INTRO
JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
AMIR: Let go of me!
JAKE: I'm not touching you.
AMIR: Why not?



Jake and Amir are walking side by side.

AMIR: What was the last thing you said to her?

JAKE: I don't remember.

AMIR: I'm sorry.

JAKE: Thanks.

AMIR: You're just gonna let me feel like this is my fault?

JAKE: What?

AMIR: I said, I'm sorry, and you said, Thanks. Like I'm apologizing? Like, I didn't do anything.

JAKE: Okay. I can't have this conversation with you right now.

AMIR: Although, who has two thumbs and should be apologizing for not doing anything? This guy. (Pointing at Jake.) No, I'm just kidding. You tried to push her out of the way when the bus hit her though, right?

JAKE: Look, it happened really, really fast, alright?

AMIR: Yeah, really, really fast. From your girlfriend to dead in two minutes flat. It's a world record. Hazzah!

JAKE: Jesus Christ man, we just buried her.

AMIR: Yeah. This is my way of coping with things, okay? Trust me, I'm hurting more than you are.

JAKE: I seriously doubt that.

They stop walking.

AMIR: Wait, you think you're sadder than I am?

JAKE: No, I know I'm sadder than you are.

AMIR: Ha!

JAKE: See, you're laughing.

AMIR: Okay, she was my girlfriend for longer.

JAKE: Yeah, but she was my girlfriend when it happened.

AMIR: Yes, but we had a deeper connection.

JAKE: Ha!

Amir points at Jake.

JAKE: Okay, fair enough but we we're about to begin something new and amazing and it all got cut short.

AMIR: Yeah, that sounds alot like my story with her. Only, in my version, you were the bus.

Jake pushes Amir.

AMIR: Don't run me over, bus.

They briefly push each other then stop.

AMIR: It's crazy, huh?

JAKE: What is?

AMIR: One minute, you're here. The next, worm food.

JAKE: Yeah, I guess.

AMIR: Isn't it weird that worms are cannibals?

JAKE: They're not.

AMIR: They eat humans.

JAKE: That's not cannibalism. Cannibalism is when you eat your own species.

AMIR: So you're saying worms don't eat other worms?

JAKE: I'm saying I don't know, but either way that's not what you meant.

AMIR: Isn't it?

JAKE: I feel like I've had this conversation with you before.
