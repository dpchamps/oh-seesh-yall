[Intro]
Amir: [In an over the top British accent] Hey you're watching Jake and Amir, see?

Jake: Why are you talking like that?

Amir: Nyaa!

Jake: Alright...

[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir is watching a video on his computer with headphones plugged in. He takes handfuls of chips out of a bag and shoves them into his mouth as he laughs loudly. Jake is visibly annoyed but says nothing.]

Amir: [Laughs hysterically but then suddenly turns straight faced] Oh

[Amir starts laughing again and continues eating. He finishes the chips and starts to eat through the bottom of the packet. He then eats through his jeans. Jake is joined by Sarah and David and they all watch in silence as Amir tears of some of his skin and eats it, still laughing. Amir's laughs become closer to crying sounds as he pulls chunks of his leg out and puts them in his mouth. Jake is joined by Murph, Kevin and Caldwell and they all watch in horror as Amir tears out a bone from his leg and bites into it]

Jake: Hey dude

Amir: [Taking off his headphones] What's up?

Jake: Can I have a chip?

Amir: Yeah [Amir laughs. As he looks down into the chip packet his smile disappears and he looks back at Jake. He then screams]
