Amir: (sung) I'm the one who wants to be with you. Be with you.

Jake: Woah, you were singing that?

Amir: What?

Jake: I thought it was a cd. It was pretty good!

Amir: Really?

Jake: I mean, have you ever taken voice lessons?

Amir: I mean, I did choir in, like, fifth grade.

Jake: Wow.

Amir: But not 'cuz I wanted to, because my mom said I had to do something after school, and I didn't want to do basketball 'cuz I was too good, not because I like singing.

Jake: No, it shows. You should, I mean you should walk around the office more and just sing in front of people. 

Amir: Who would walk around singing?

Jake: Yeah.

Amir (singing): Build up your confidence and you can be on time for once. Wake up, who cares about-

Amir (singing): So make the best of this test and don't ask why. It's not a question but a lesson learned in time.

Amir: Hey. Did I get, uh, a fax? 

Amir: Amanda, I had a question for you. 

Amanda: Can it wait? I'm really- 

Amir (interrupting): It's... actually I just forgot it, so it doesn't matter.

Amanda: (laughs) Alright, yeah, well I mean...

Amir: So weird that that happens.

Amanda: Ok.

Amir (singing): Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to give.

Amir (singing): I wish you would step out from that ledge, my friend. I would understand.

Sam: Hey man. We have a meeting in here in, like, two minutes. 

Amir: You want me to sing during it?

Sam: I want you to leave during it.

Amir (singing): How wonderful life is.

Jake: Sounds good, man.

Amir: Thank you! It sounds good, man. Right?

Amir (singing): Even more in love with me you'd fall.

Amanda: I have to get back to work.

Amir: Yeah. Dumb bitch. 

Amir: So, sing before, or...

Sam: No singing, just leaving.

Amir: Got it. (whispered) Dickhead.

Amir: I mean, nobody else thinks I'm good; they don't see it. 

Jake: I was just kidding. I think you have a horrible singing voice. It's not good at all. 

Amir: No duh. Like I want to be good at singing. That's a gay sport.
