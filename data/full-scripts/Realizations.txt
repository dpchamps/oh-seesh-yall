Sarah: Oh, hey Amir. Uh, I heard you and Mike are really hitting it off.

Amir: That's a bit of an understatement, don't you think?

Sarah: Are, are you gay?

Amir: What?! God, no. Why?

Sarah: I mean, you know Mike's gay?

Amir: OK, I'm not going to stand here and listen to you talk smack behind his back.

Sarah: Amir, it's not a bad thing.

Amir: Yes, Sarah, it is. Gay means bad, like if I wanted to insult your shoes and they were bad or whatever I'd be like Hey, you have 
gay shoes. You have gay shoes.

Sarah: Amir, gay means homosexual.

Amir: I know. What does that mean?

Sarah: It means that Mike wants to have sex with you.

Amir: So you think Mike's a woman? Trust me, he's not.

Mike: Oh hey guys.

Amir: Oh hey Mike. I was just leaving.

Mike: Hey Amir, do you want to go to the bathroom together?

Amir: Sure, meet you in the men's room.

Mike: Same stall?

Amir: For sure.

(New scene: Jake is in California jogging on the beach when Amir's voice comes up on his iPod)

Amir: Hey Jake, it's Amir, I hope you don't mind, I put this song on your iPod. It's about your name so... J is Jake and A is for 
apple, nothing starts with K, and E is for elephant. I just thought of something that starts with K, it's carrot, yo it's carrot!



Outro

(Continuing from end of episode)

Amir: This next one's like a hard core rap song, so maybe turn down your iPod. Yow! Motherfuâ€”
