INTRO

AMIR: Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake Jake Jake. Jake your booty.

JAKE: Stop!



AMIR: (joining Jake on couch) Hey, dude, thanks for meeting me here.

JAKE: (simultaneously) Oh, bad odor!

AMIR: So how do people make money today?

JAKE: I'm not meeting you here. Ok, I was just in here.

AMIR: That's right, creating iPad apps.

JAKE: Don't think that I agreed to a meeting. 

AMIR: And, what better way to create iPad apps than in a meeting that both people agreed to?



AMIR: Ok, first app idea. You know how it's hard to manage your time, like time management?

JAKE: Sure.

AMIR: So this is just a list of other shit that's hard to deal with.

JAKE: Really? Number one says wiping. 

AMIR: Yes.

JAKE: That shouldn't be that hard.

AMIR: And yet it is.

JAKE: No it's not.

AMIR: Ok.



JAKE: (holds up iPad) Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce. 

AMIR: I was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.

JAKE: You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!



JAKE: Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.

AMIR: That's an example of something I do all the time.

JAKE: I know.



AMIR: The hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.

JAKE: What's the app?

AMIR: I'm not always talking about apps.



AMIR: So, you hate the Papua New Guinean community, I hate the Papua New Guinean community. So let's just agree-

JAKE: Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community. 

AMIR: Ok. So this app might be a dud. (snorts)



AMIR: This one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.

JAKE: How?

AMIR: It's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your iPad. (chuckles)

JAKE: Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-

AMIR: Barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. That was a picture of-

JAKE: Ribs.

AMIR: Exactly right, how did you-

JAKE: How is that not what it sounds like?

AMIR: You're getting defensive.

JAKE: Oh my-



AMIR: It's called Photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.

JAKE: That app has been around for a while.

AMIR: Yeah, well I created a lens for it, called fisheye.

JAKE: I feel so bad for you, man.

AMIR: If you're gonna call me out on every single white lie I tell, just, just leave, I'm serious man.

JAKE: Fine. (gets up)

AMIR: Bahh! When I'm done!

JAKE: What is that noise?

AMIR: What noise?

JAKE: It just comes out of your mouth when I go to leave. (gets up)

AMIR: I guess so- Bahh!



AMIR: You're in a bad place right now and I feel like even if I pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.

JAKE: You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?

AMIR: (taps iPad) Alright.



JAKE: Actually you know what? (takes iPad) I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.

AMIR: Oh my God, I have a case for it, relax.

JAKE: The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.

AMIR: Call me out. Call me out in front of all your big friends so that I can feel small. 

JAKE: Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.

AMIR: Don't compartmentalize me like I'm a chore. 

JAKE: You spit all over my fucking arm just now.

AMIR: (huggine Jake) I hate when we fight like this.

JAKE: Stop!



AMIR: Alright, so this one's a hoot and a half. (laughs briefly) What's the hardest part about reading?

JAKE: Finding the time.

AMIR: Ok, never mind.

JAKE: Your app idea just says the vowels.

AMIR: Never mind, I said!



AMIR: You try to put everything in a box. And if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away. (pause, reaches for hug) I'm sorry.

JAKE: Get-



AMIR: So you know how Instagram sold for (puts pinky to lip) one billion dollars?

JAKE: Don't do that.

AMIR: (laughs) So this would be an app that harasses the creators of Instagram until they give us a few million dollars to stop.

JAKE: Alright, don't take this as a compliment.

AMIR: Thank you.

JAKE: That's your best app idea yet.

AMIR: Appreciate it.

JAKE: It's still terrible.

AMIR: Danke.

JAKE: It's just all your other ideas are so bad.

AMIR: Gracias. (laughs)

JAKE: Ok, don't take this-

AMIR: Todah rabah. 

JAKE: Fuck you!

(pause, Amir recoils)

AMIR: (whispers) Ouch.



JAKE: Hey, brace yourself 'cause this is not gonna be pleasant.

AMIR: Oh no, constructive criticism!

JAKE: Quit. 

AMIR: (faintly) Ow.

JAKE: Not even quit while you're ahead, quit while you're behind. None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board. 

AMIR: Right, yeah, yeah.

JAKE: I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.

AMIR: That's fine, Ok.

JAKE: Furthermore,

AMIR: Oh?

JAKE: You're not smart.

AMIR: No.

JAKE: You're not getting better.

AMIR: Nope.

JAKE: You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself. You can't even take care of this iPad. So I say, let's toss out the iPad. We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?

AMIR: Yeah.

JAKE: With your time.

AMIR: At least I gave it the old college try, you know?

JAKE: I'm not sure you did.

AMIR: Well, at least I tried my best, you know? (snorts)

JAKE: That is sad, because it wasn't even close to being good enough.

AMIR: (tapping couch) Absolutely (snorts) I just, uh. Quit it, alright, you're making me feel weak.

JAKE: You are weak.

AMIR: (raising voice) Enough! Ok, you're not creative!
