INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, unless you're my parents in which case, you're NEVER watching it.

JAKE: Wow.

AMIR: Yeah



JAKE: Okay, guys, Texas Hold 'Em is the name of the game.  You know the rules, there are two blinds-

STREETER: Amir is standing right behind you.

JAKE: Buddy, I told you you could go home.  It's a half day, you do NOT need to be here.

AMIR: I like that you called me a buddy.

JAKE: I cannot believe you write that down.

AMIR: What are we playing?

JAKE: You're leaving.

AMIR: Nooo, you can't physically force me to leave, so let's figure something out.

JAKE: I probably COULD physically force you to leave.

AMIR: Ahh, please don't!

JAKE: Okay, look, you could stay, under two conditions.

AMIR: Fine.

JAKE: Let me say what the conditions are and you might be so insulted, that you decide to leave.

AMIR: Doubtful.

JAKE: You can't talk.

AMIR: Fine.

JAKE: No speaking...

AMIR: Good.

JAKE: ...laughing, doing anything to disrupt us, and you're not allowed to uh, play.

AMIR: (mocking) Oh no, I can't play. (Normal) Ah ha ha, yeah, I just wanna be here next to you.  That's fine.

STELLA: So sad.

GUY: Jake, can we just play?

JAKE: Yeah, sorry,

AMIR: Wait, before you guys start...

JAKE: So you're talking right off the bat.

AMIR: It's a question.  I wanna ask a question.

JAKE: Did you talk it? Because I said no talking.

AMIR: You mean did you speak it.  You can't talk it, you don't say did can talk it, you moron.

JAKE: You're a moron.

AMIR: Does anyone want sandwiches?  There.  That's my question.  God forbid I ask it!

GUY: I'll take a sandwich.

STELLA: Yeah.

STREETER: Sure, I'll take one.

AMIR: Oh what a surprise, Streeter wants a sandwich.  Oh wait, that's not a surprise.  The way he's bigger than anyone else is that he eats sandwiches more frequently than the average person.

S: Come on!

AMIR: Ten dollars, everybody give me ten dollars.

JAKE: So you're not buying them.

AMIR: I'm BUYING them.  I just don't want to PAY FOR THEM, you grammar Nazi.  Who here thinks I'm right?

(Stella raises her hand)

JAKE: Why?

AMIR: I like word play.  I've always been the kind of girl who's been like Hmmm, I don't know, CAN you go to the bathroom? Heh.

AMIR: I like this one.  Her skin's a little greasy and her eyebrows are WAY too thick, but she's fun, and I think she likes me, too.

JAKE: Okay, you were just narrating that entire thing.

AMIR: It was then that I realized I was narrating along the entire time.  Did the grease princess hear what I had to say about her eyebrows.  We may never know?

STELLA: Yeah, I did.

AMIR: My mind was racing.

JAKE: Okay, let's just play.  Uh, Stella, you're small blinds.  Streeter, you're big.

AMIR: Yes, he is very big.

JAKE: You know what dude, that's enough, you can go home.  Cuz  I said no talking, and if anything, you're talking more than you usually do.  You seem incapable of even having an internal monologue.

AMIR: Okay, give me one more chance!  Give me one more chance!  If I make one joke that makes everybody here crack the fuck up, then I get to stay and play.

JAKE: Why would I agree to that?

AMIR: Because if I don't, if my joke falls flat, then I will leave you alone for the rest of your life.

JAKE: (Beat) Wow.  Sure, yeah.  I'll take that.  Go ahead.

AMIR: (singing) When there's something gay in your neighborhood, who you gonna call?  Nutbusters!

(Everyone except Jake laughs)

STREETER: (While laughing) You're the king!

JAKE: My milkshake brings all the gays to the yard, and they're like I'm gayer than y'all, ye-

(No one is laughing)

STELLA: Horrible.

STREETER: I have a gay cousin.

JAKE: I'm sorry!
