AMIR: Welcome to episode 3 of Ace and Jocelyn - Astronaut Accountants from Outer Space!

(intro-Ace and Jocelyn, from space and Jocelyn, astronaut accountants and they're coming to your face, if you love that shiz say na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-hey!)

AMIR: We're here alone in the...space office, and I have a feeling Ace will be back, because you can't get very far without your space wallet, or ... more specifically, his space Subway card. Now it's just a matter of time, co-space cowboys - (gasp) in fact. Here he is right now! Ace! (trips and falls, drops camera which is facing him on floor) Ahh! Oww, Ace! You really got to help me out man, I really hurt my knee. (moans)

JAKE: Wow, you're actually bleeding.

AMIR: Yes, but it's-it's space blood, so it hurts extra a lot. 

JAKE: You took my wallet, right? 

AMIR: Ugh, I found your wallet, it was in the Zorlap Sky. Ugh, the gravity here is so strong.

JAKE: All right, do you want me to help you up?

AMIR: I don't normally fall. 

JAKE: Say my name and I'll help you.

AMIR: Ace, what's wrong?

JAKE: Say my real name and I'll help you.

AMIR: You're acting weird. Did somebody hit you with an amnesia gun, Ace? Please, help me up.

JAKE: Listen, Amir. You're hurt. Say my real name, and I'm going to help you. 

AMIR: Turn the camera off first.

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Turn-I don't know how to edit.  Turn it off.

JAKE: You don't have to upload it.

AMIR: I wish that were true.

JAKE: It is true. Say my name. 

AMIR: I'm in a lot of pain, Jake. Help me up. 

JAKE: Here. (goes to help Amir up)

AMIR: I can't straighten my leg...(looks at camera) Thank you, Ace. (Jake drops him) Oww!!

(blackout) 

(Jake is cleaning up the wound)

AMIR: AH! It stings! It stings!

JAKE: I barely even touched it yet! 

AMIR: You're right, Ace. I should be brave. 

(Jake applies the wipe harder)

AMIR: AHHHH--

THE END.
