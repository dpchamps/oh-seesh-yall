INTRO: Amir - Hi, and welcome to your worst nightmares, britches.

Jake - I think you mean bitches. 

Amir - Whatever.



AMIR: Hey Jake, check it out. (singsong) It's my dick in a box!

JAKE: (smacks the box away) ...

AMIR: Oh, my god!! What the heck is your problem?! 

JAKE: Put your dick away, man! 

AMIR: OK, it was away. It was in a box.

JAKE: My brother is going to be here, any second, and I really--

(Kumail sneaks up behind Jake and covers his eyes) 

KUMAIL: Guess who?

AMIR: I don't know who you are, so I can't guess, right?

JAKE: That's what guessing is. Kumail!

KUMAIL: What's up, brother? Oh, my god.  You must be Amir. I've heard a lot about you! 

AMIR: Well, I've heard nothing about you. 

JAKE: That's because I haven't seen Kumail, in like what, 13 years! 

AMIR: Ho-oh, really? You haven't seen each other since you were negative four then? 

KUMAIL: (chuckles) You were right, he can't even do basic math.

JAKE: Or talk.

AMIR: (gibberish)

JAKE: OK, I'm going to go to the bathroom man, and when I get back, we have checking up to do.

KUMAIL: Yeah we do!  (Jake leaves, Kumail stares at Amir deadpan) 

AMIR: So . . . 

KUMAIL: Shut the fuck up and help me find his pay stubs! 

AMIR: Pay stubs? (an orange is thrown at Amir) God! Uh, he keeps them in Connecticut, in his house, in a safe.

KUMAIL: Really? Darn. Because I found a bunch of them right here. 

AMIR: Oh.

KUMAIL: Now I know you're a liar.

AMIR: Uh.

KUMAIL: This is not good for you. 

AMIR: Yeah. I have to call Jake, I totally forgot but I have to call-- 

KUMAIL: Give me that. 

(Kumail grabs Amirs cell and throws it against the wall; Jake enters) 

JAKE: Hey Kumail, you ready to roll? 

KUMAIL: Yeah, sure thing! This dude just threw his cell phone against the wall. (laughs) 

JAKE: Again? 

AMIR: No.

JAKE: God, you're stupid man. 

AMIR: Jake. Dinner tonight. Right now! Trust me. 

JAKE: Sure, yeah (beat) because, did you know that Amir is the last person on earth? 

KUMAIL: Really? The very last person on earth?

JAKE: Yeah, that's the only reason I'd ever ditch dinner with you and have dinner with him. 

AMIR: No, I'm not--

KUMAIL: Zing! 

JAKE: Later, dude. 

KUMAIL: (ominously) Later, dude. 

(Jake and Kumail leave, Josh enters)

AMIR: (sighs)

JOSH: You gotta stop doing this, man.

AMIR: OK, I didn't throw THROW THAT!  This time. Sorry. Uh, I shouldn't yell. OK, just, uh, so frustrating. 

JOSH: Your dick is out.

AMIR: I know. 

THE END.
