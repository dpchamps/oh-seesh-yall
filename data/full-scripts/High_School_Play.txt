Amir: You're watching Drake and Amir! Not hard.

Jake: Not right!

Amir: Barely!



Amir: Okay, why do they call this a high school play? They should be calling it a high school work... 'Cause it's boring. (laughs)

Jake: It hasn't started yet.

Amir: Okay, I got, like, fifty more of those jokes, and if you're gonna nitpick every single one of 'em, they're almost not even worth saying.

Jake: Then don't.

Amir: ALMOST! ...I said.



Amir: NO, DON'T GO IN THERE!

Jake: Shhh...

Amir: What? It's not a movie, okay? There are actual actors here; they can hear me.

Jake: Exactly.

Amir: Heed my advice!

Jake: No...

Amir: I feel like I'm directing it.

Jake: Wow, bad way to feel.

Amir: CUT! Sorry.



Amir: Hey, which one's your cousin? I wanna heckle him.

Jake: It's a girl.

Amir: Then she's not your cousin! ...She's your nephew. (chuckles)

Jake: You're even wrong when you're already wrong.

Amir: ...That's beautiful. (takes out phone)

Jake: Don't e-mail that to yourself. Hey! (reaches for phone)

Amir: HEY!



Amir: I don't get this at all.

Jake: It's a musical.

Amir: Yeah, it doesn't explain why people are randomly singing and dancing.

Jake: Yes, it does!

Amir: Does!

Jake: It does.

Amir: Yeah.



[Amir has earphones in.]

Jake: Hey, can you not listen to your iPod?

Amir: WHAT?

Jake: Shhh, wow, please stop listening to music, okay?

Amir: It's not music, okay? It's a podcast. Check it. (moves earbud to Jake's ear)

Jake: Yeah, it sounds like a crazy person screaming into a microphone.

Amir: Yeah, that's the name of the podcast. Okay, my cousin mikes up a bunch of homeless people throughout the city and sorta just lets 'em loose.



Amir: Ugh, I really have to take a dump.

Jake: Then go to the bathroom.

Amir: Don't tell me where to shit, man! Okay? Legit prairie doggin' it.

Jake: (looking down) Oh no...

Amir: (looking down) Oh yeah, he's on the loose...



[Amir has his headphones in again.]

Jake: Just watch the play.

Amir: I am watching, okay? I'm just not listening.



Amir: (singing) Go grease lightning, you're burning up the quarter mile! (talking) Smiley f—

Jake: Please stop. Please stop.

Amir: I'm singing along, okay?

Jake: This isn't Grease.



Amir: You think you're a hot shot 'cause you got a cousin? (laughs) Big whoop, you smug prick. I have twenty-seven nieces and nephews.

Jake: Okay, great, just be quiet.

Amir: Eleven girls, eleven boys. That's all I'll say.

Jake: Thank you, just talk to me about it after the show. Please.

Amir: Okay, fine. Their names are Ryan, Brian, Cryin', Fryin', and Sandra, The Little Engine That Can't.

Jake: Wow, mean nickname.

Amir: Yeah, she has, like, no knee, all right? She's got legit no knees, so we—we sorta discourage her from doing stuff.



Amir: (singing) You are supreme! Uh, uh! The chicks will cream! Uh, uh!

Man in Audience: Hey!

Amir: HEY YOU!

Jake: Okay...

Amir: I got a kid up there, man!

Jake: (restraining Amir) Stop.



[The Principal is lecturing Jake and Amir.]

Principal: These kids have been working their butts off for five months, and you two guys are ruining it!

Amir: (makes fart noise) Oh, Principal Farley farted! (chuckles) ...Tough crowd! Yeah, we'll be quiet.



[The audience is clapping at the end of the play.]

Amir: BOOOO! BOOOO! BOO! ENCORE!

Jake: Why encore?

Amir: I wanna boo them one more time! (clapping) BOO!
