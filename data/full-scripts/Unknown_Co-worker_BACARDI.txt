INTRO: Jake and Amir's Get Together Project

AMIR: You'll never guess who I ran into in the elevator. 

JAKE: Who?

AMIR: Guess!

JAKE: You just told me not to guess. 

AMIR: No, I said you'll never guess. 

JAKE: it's the same thing. 

AMIR: It's not. It's not even close. 

JAKE: It's at least close... Steve. 

AMIR: I don't know... what? Who's that? What's he saying?

JAKE: I don't know, a guy who works here, maybe? 

AMIR: No, I shouldn't have even had you guess. I don't even know anyone's name anyway. 

JAKE: Honestly, man? I was bluffing. I don't know anyone's name either. 

AMIR: Yeah, which makes it all the worse that I barrelled into this dude in the elevator. 

JAKE: Oh, you like literally ran into him. 

AMIR: Yeah. I mean, accidentally but like at full speed, yeah. 

JAKE: Why? 

AMIR: I didn't know his name. 

JAKE: That's not what I asked. 

AMIR: Heh. I don't even know your name. 

JAKE: Wow. 

AMIR: No. That's not it. It starts with a D, right? 

JAKE: It's Jake, you say it all the time. 

AMIR: Dude we should have a party. A get together. 

JAKE: I know what a party is. You should leave work before you ge - 

AMIR: No no no we should just introduce each other to everybody, you know, at the party? That way, we can learn everybody's names. 

JAKE: We're supposed to already know everybody's names. 

AMIR: I have an idea. 

Screen goes black. The caption "...5 minutes later" appears. After, Amir is eating a roll.  

JAKE: You really might be in trouble. What was your idea by the way, you haven't said anything. 

AMIR: Oh it's just to get this sandwich, I was hungry. 

JAKE: Gotcha.

AMIR: Ok, NOW I have an idea. 

Another "...5 minutes later" caption appears.

AMIR: Mm! Yeah! It's way better with ketchup!

JAKE: Good for you. Alright, now I have an idea. 

Another caption "...5 minutes later" appears. Afterwards, there are people standing around with "Hello my name is" nametags on. 

JAKE: Welcome to our nametag get together... Martin! 

MARTIN: What's with the nametags? 

AMIR: Oh, it's obviously a joke. We already know each other's names.

JOEL: I don't know your name. 

AMIR: Well, you're a terrible human being, Joe-f. 

JOEL: Joel. 

AMIR: Joel. Right.
