INTRO:
JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and a-OHH AHH YOU'RE BITING ME!
AMIR: Geez, relax!
JAKE: I'm bleeding!
AMIR: (Laughs)
JAKE: What.
AMIR: Good question.
JAKE: No, do- I didn't start this conversation.
AMIR: After a year of inner turmoil, some deep reflective thought, and a lot of, um, light soul searching, I've decided to finally heed your advice and delete my reddit account, so... Salut.
JAKE: Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.
AMIR: Sorry... what?
JAKE: You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?
AMIR: Yeah, haha! Sorry.
JAKE: It's not a good thing, so. Right?
AMIR: Yeah yeah yeah, what were you saying?
JAKE: It's a picture of Yosemite Valley at sunrise, you commented "How is this Earth, and how is this porn."
AMIR: Good question.
JAKE (Still reading from Amir's comment): "If you wanna blow your nut hair back, check my imgur account" and then the link is a picture of you photoshopped, poorly by the way...
AMIR: No.
JAKE: Yes, your face on Ron Jeremy's body's fucking a map of Africa. That's Earth Porn to you?
AMIR: It's subversive!
JAKE: It's definitely not!
AMIR: I'm sorry. I had no idea you were a circlejerking diva, when were you gonna come out of the closet on that one?
AMIR (At the same time Jake is speaking): Yeah, how long have we known each other that you weren't gonna, yeah, you weren't gonna come out to me? Come on, I'm your best friend, tell me that you're a diva.
JAKE (At the same time Amir is speaking): Really? Really? That's how you wanna play this? That's how you're gonna do this? Everybody who thinks you're an asshole?
JAKE: Everyone who thinks you're an asshole for posting mean comments and linking to porn? They're a circlejerking diva, and nothing's wrong with you?
AMIR: Yeah. Exactly right, I'm glad you see things MY WAY! My way or the highway!
JAKE: Fred Durst?
AMIR: Exactly right.
JAKE: You're a loser, man.
AMIR: Oh, really?
JAKE: Yeah.
AMIR: I don't know if you saw this, but it was trending quite worldwide on twitter, last week, this loser? Went dickless for Michael Chiklis. So. I don't know.
JAKE: Right, I see that post. Picture of you from a webcam with your dick tucked between your legs? The text on top reads "Saw every Michael Chiklis movie" text on the bottom reads "Went dickless for him." You posted it in a subreddit called Jake and Amir! You know I don't approve of that.
AMIR: I'm a good guy greg.
JAKE: You're absolutely not.
AMIR: I am, I am a good guy greg.
JAKE: You're a scumbag steve.
AMIR (Way too angry): Shut the FUCK up! Shut the FUCK up with that!
JAKE (Shouting to the office): Is this okay?
AMIR: No, it's not! Take it back!
JAKE: You know, you also post a lot in explain it to me like I'm five. Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.
AMIR: The comments were helpful, and I appreciated them.
JAKE: How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote "OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die."
AMIR: To which I zung'd him back!
JAKE: You wrote "How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes."
AMIR: To which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.
JAKE: They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.
AMIR: And counting!
JAKE: You commented on his post "I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime." Did you even set up an AMA for that?
AMIR: Didn't need to.
JAKE: Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!
AMIR: You know what, enough. Okay? I already regret even bringing up the fact that I was gonna delete my reddit account because quite frankly at this point in time, I don't even see me having the huevos to pull it off! I really don't!
JAKE: If you need a little encouragement, why don't you look at the front page. Where it says "If this post gets ten thousand upvotes Amir Blumenfeld will kill himself."
AMIR: And?
JAKE: Got a hundred and fifty.
AMIR: Yes.
JAKE: Thousand. Upvotes.
AMIR: A thousand?
JAKE: A hundred and fifty thousand. For you to kill yourself.
AMIR: No, I know.
JAKE: Like they want you dead. Yeah.
AMIR starts crying
JAKE: Okay. Of course. Yeah? A little tears?
AMIR: Yeah.
JAKE: Crying?
AMIR: Yeah.
JAKE: Sobbing?
AMIR: Yeah.
JAKE: Thirty years old though?
AMIR: Uh huh.
JAKE: Almost thirty one?
AMIR: Oh yeah.
JAKE: Alright.
AMIR: Am I really on the front page?
JAKE: Yeah, it's on the front page but you-
AMIR: My name?
JAKE: Yup.
AMIR: On the front page of REDDIT?
(AMIR's crying turns into laughter)
AMIR: A hah hah hah hah hah hah. YEAH! WOO!
JAKE: You're happy.
AMIR: Today I learned that I'm a pimp and a cool! Upvote me to karma heaven baby!
