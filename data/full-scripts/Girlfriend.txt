Episode

Amir: Kinda crazy, huh?

Jake: What is?

Amir: One minute you're here, the next... (Acts out a catastrophic collision with his fingers) you're wormfood.

Jake: I guess.

Amir: Isn't it weird that worms are cannibals?

Jake: They're not.

Amir: They eat humans.

Jake: That's not cannibalism, cannibalism is when you eat your own species.

Amir: So you're saying worms don't eat other worms.

Jake: I'm saying I don't know, but either way that's not what you meant.

Amir: Isn't it?

Jake: I feel like I've had this conversation with you before.

Amir: Hmh, I think you might be thinking of the conversation I had with my girlfriend last night.

Jake: Hey Pat, I'm not getting your emails.

Amir: Hey Pat, you're not getting my girlfriend. (Chuckles) No... What? Jake. Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! JAKE I have a girlfriend, okay? 
Oo, big whoop. Yeah, it's a huge whoop, and you're not saying anything about it. Why are you being so obvious?

Jake: Oblivious?

Amir: Look who decided to show up, ladies and Germanies!

Jake: Where'd you meet her?

Amir: What's with the third degree? Can't somebody have a private life? At a laser tag. Read between the lines.

Jake: No lines there. So you met her at your cousin's laser tag?

Amir: (Sticking out his arm) Oo twist my leg why don'tcha!

Jake: That's your arm. What's her name?

Amir: Her name, is her mane, and that's all that's her-mane cause she's Popeye the sailor dame! Toot toot! Ay yai yai! Ay caramba! 
Arriba! This stuff's made in New York City!

Jake: (Cutting off Amir) So you couldn't think of a name fast enough. Here's a lying tip: think of possible questions I'm going to ask 
you?

Amir: Okay, her name is Leron...a. Lerona.

Jake: Lerona. Kinda like your cousin's name, which is Leron, except with an 'a' at the end.

Amir: Yes.

Jake: Lying tip number two?

(Lerona enters, hugging Amir from behind)

Lerona: Hi.

Amir: Hey there.

Jake: Woah.

Lerona: (To Jake) Hi.

Jake: Hey. You must be Lerona.

Lerona: Yeah, but it's Leron-uh. Like you're confused.

Jake: I am confused.

Amir: So.

Lerona: (To Amir) Hi!

(Lerona kisses Amir)

Amir: Mmm, I missed you.

Lerona: I missed you.

Jake: Very confused.

(Lerona tousles Amir's hair, both laughing)

Amir: I like that.
