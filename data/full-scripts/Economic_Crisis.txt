JAKE: Okay, let me explain  the economic crisis to you so you don't embarrass yourself in another meeting like that.

AMIR: Oh, that was really embarrassing. I think I get everything there's nothing to explain.

JAKE: Okay, it's not about fish. Or ice. Dave Coulier, Dinosaurs...

AMIR: JUST EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

AMIR: So these bangs, they distributed the money...

JAKE: Bangs or banks?

AMIR: What?

JAKE: Bangs or banks, what did you say?

AMIR: What did you say?

JAKE: So a lot of people couldn't pay back these loans.

AMIR: Ohhhhhh, okay. I just remembered where I left my keys this morning.

JAKE: Gah!

AMIR: Ohh, wait. Let me just show you my new cool walk for one second.

JAKE: Dont. You're Twittering.

AMIR: No.

JAKE: Dear Twitter, No idea what Jake is talking about. 

AMIR: You don't know who I wrote that to.

AMIR: No, no, no, thank you.

JAKE: I didn't say thank you.

AMIR: Okay, what did you say?

JAKE: Stock Market.

AMIR: Oh there's just nothing left to do but go to a bar and get drunk, I guess.

JAKE: You're not going to get me to go to a bar.

AMIR: Alright, WHY NOT?

JAKE: Stop freaking out.

AMIR: Okay so like the recession is kinda like this girl from back home. She's cute but not too cute but you like hook up with her when you go home for Thanksgiving but like the subprime mess is like, like an old hoodie...

JAKE: What are you doing?

AMIR: I don't know. Sometimes people say like metaphors and they make sense, right?

JAKE: Not when you say them.

AMIR: How random would it be if I just socked you in the face right now?

AMIR: So you're saying that subprime lend crisis customer default bank responsibility...

JAKE: Those are words that I said but there were other words in between them and they weren't in that order so...

AMIR: So you're saying it's all about the Benjamins, baby?

JAKE: No that's Puff Daddy. No that's the plot of the first Star Wars movie. No that's you trying to speak pig latin. No and that's offensive to Asian people. No, that's the sound of your head banging on wood. No, you're talking about deep fried oreos covered in cake...

AMIR: Wrapped in cake.

JAKE: If you're just going to watch time-lapse videos, maybe you should go back to your desk.

AMIR: Alright, FINE.

JAKE: With you're own computer!

AMIR: Okay, SO SAY THAT.
