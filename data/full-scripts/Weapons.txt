JAKE: Hey Amir.

(Jake pretends to shoot Amir. Amir plays along, but keeps throwing grenades over and over again.)

JAKE: That's good. You win. Tie, or whatever. I just have to answer this email. One sec. I'm dead! Done. Alright. Stop for one second, I just gotta make a phone call. Mom? Hey, did you call me before?

(Amir pulls out a real gun.)

JAKE: I have to call you back.

(Cuts to black; shooting noise is heard.)
