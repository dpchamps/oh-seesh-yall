[Jake, Rosie, Amir Cohen, and a woman are standing in Jake's apartment hallway, drinking some yellow beverage. Funkytown by Lipps Inc is playing in the background.]

WOMAN: Thanks for having me over, you guys, I'm having a blast.

JAKE: Yeah, it really just feels good to get away from work.

AMIR COHEN: What do you have to complain about? Your job's so easy.

JAKE: It's not so much the job--

WOMAN: You don't look stressed, though.

JAKE: Yeah, I'm feeling better now.

(Six loud knocks on the door are heard.)

ROSIE: Who is that?

JAKE: Oh I think Pat might be coming.

(Jake walks over to the door and opens it, finding Pat standing outside, looking despondent.)

JAKE: Cassels! What took you so long, man?

PAT: I'm so sorry.

JAKE: For...

(Amir sticks his head sideways out from behind the doorframe.)

AMIR: Jake!

JAKE: Oh, wow. (to Pat) You really need to learn how to defend yourself.

AMIR: (squeezing Pat's head agaist his own shoulder) He does! (walking inside) Is this shit BYO-Noug? Cuz I did nay! (falsetto)



[The woman is talking to Rosie in the hallway. Amir is talking to Jake by the doorway. Pat is standing next to them.]

AMIR: Jake, thoughts on leaving, right now.

JAKE: Nonexistent.

AMIR: WITH, me.

JAKE: Same answer.

AMIR: (slamming Pat's arm up against the wall) Cassels why don't you get us a drink!

PAT: What?

AMIR: I don't know, this.. yellow cranberry juice, just please! (Pat walks to get a drink) Bye! We're having a--

JAKE: (to Pat) Sorry.

AMIR: --conversation.

(Amir looks over and sees the woman and Rosie.)

AMIR: OUHHHG! That's the girl from your computerrrrrrrrr--

JAKE: SHHHH Shut up!

AMIR: Maybe she's deaf!

JAKE: She's def-initely not.

AMIR: Lemme go over there and talk to her, I think I can hook you up--royal.

JAKE: Don't.

AMIR: God. Lemme just talk to her for thirty seconds, guaranteed you guys'll be frenching by the end of the month.

JAKE: You will probably build me up... ...Go ahead.

AMIR: (exhales.) You won't regret this.

(Amir does the hop from Hop To It over to the woman and Rosie.)

AMIR: Hi. (small laugh)

WOMAN: Hello...

AMIR: Ah, don't bother flirting with me, this isn't about that.

WOMAN: Ok.. (looks relieved)

AMIR: Rosie, can you actually give us twenty, or thirty minutes, or, just leave entirely?

WOMAN: (to Rosie) Sorry...

ROSIE: (walking into another room) Good luck.

AMIR: Um, I think my friend has a little bit of a crush on you.

WOMAN: Which friend?

AMIR: Uh, the guy in the red. (points to Jake, who waves at Amir and the woman as they look over.)

WOMAN: Really?

AMIR: Yeah.

WOMAN: He's so cute.

JAKE: (quietly, to Pat) It's really working.

AMIR: You think so?

WOMAN: I do.

AMIR: I'm gonna bring him over here, and maybe you guys can talk.

WOMAN: Do it, yeah! Tell him, definitely.

AMIR: (about to call Jake over, but hesitates) Uhh, Oh! I totally forgot to tell you, he's so funny.

WOMAN: Is he?

AMIR: Yeah.

WOMAN: I love funny guys.

AMIR: (laughing) He's so nice and funny. Uh, today-- it's stupid, I'll oer--

WOMAN: No! Tell me, tell me. Omigod. (?) Yeah.

AMIR: (laughing) Today, we were looking at your Facebook profile on his computer,

WOMAN: Mmjm?

AMIR: ...and he was humping the monitor and high fiveing people and cracking up (laughs)

WOMAN: (dryly) Really, that sounds so funny.

AMIR: (laughing) You think so?

WOMAN: Yeah!..

AMIR: (laughing) Oh, lemme think of other jokes he did. Uhh he-- Oh! He printed out your face super big, and he cut a hole over the mouth, and he started humping it,--(cut to Jake and Pat)--(Amir is air humping) and then he cut a hole over the eye, and he was humping that too--

JAKE: She actually thinks I'm cute! She likes me!

AMIR: --Going around the office like a cowboy, huh? Still high fiveing people. (laughing) Oh my god..

WOMAN: That's.. awesome.

AMIR: (waving his hand in front of the woman's face) Can you see, by the way?

AMIR: Yeah! why--...

AMIR: He sad he'd fuck you blind. (laughing) It's so weird that you can still see--... (the woman looks away, disgusted) We should really go talk to him beca--

WOMAN: Yeah! We should! It'll be fun. Let's go!--

AMIR: --Hey--

WOMAN: --You want to?--

AMIR: --Ok. You want me to lead you there?-- (he holds his elbow out, and they link arms and walk over to Jake and Pat)

WOMAN: Yeah. Let's go!

AMIR: (laughing) Ha! Cuz you're blind..

WOMAN: That'd be so much fun.

(Amir holds two thumbs up and smiles largely as they walk over.)

AMIR: (to the woman, introducing her to Jake) Uh, you know my friend Jake, right?

WOMAN: Yeah, Jake! (to Jake) I can fucking see you, I'm not blind. (slaps him in the face and walks away.)

JAKE: K..

AMIR: ..Woww... That was awesome... (hugs Jake around the neck with one arm) MY BOY'S GETTIN FRENCHED TONIGHT!

END.
