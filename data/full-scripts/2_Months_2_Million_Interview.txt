NOTES: Evidently, I know next to nothing about poker so I may have missed out on some lingo. I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever. Oh sheesh y'all.
