[POV: Amir. Amir knocks on the apartment door to the rhythm of Shave And a Haircut. Jake opens the door.]

JAKE: [finishing the rhythm] Dun dun!

[Amir slaps Jake. Jake doesn't mind.]

JAKE: Haha! [to Rosie] Amir's here!

ROSIE: Awesome!

JAKE: Love that! Make yourself at home, comprende!

AMIR: Okay.

[Amir kicks his flip-flops off.]

AMIR: Hey guys, check this out: [singing] It's my dick in a box!

[Amir holds his hands to suggest holding a box. Jake and Rosie laugh uproariously.]

AMIR: [singing] It's my dick in a box, baby!

JAKE: [laughing] Stop-- stop it!

AMIR: Saw-ree!

JAKE: Me and Rosie were actually just talking about you, and I realized how much I hate him.

ROSIE: It's true!

[Amir and Jake high-five each other. Then Amir turns to look at a DVD sitting beside him.]

AMIR: Whoa! Is that Knocked Up on DVD? Seth Rogen! I love him! Everybody knows that. How much did this cost?

[Amir puts out his pinky and does a Dr. Evil impression.]

AMIR: One million dollars.

[Jake and Rosie burst out laughing again.]

JAKE: Nah, I actually borrowed it from that zero, Patrick Cassels!

ROSIE: He's an even bigger loser than me!

AMIR: You mind if I burn this?

JAKE: I'll take you out and buy your own copy, right now.

AMIR: Oh, gosh. You don't have to do that!

JAKE: I will!

AMIR: Oh, by the way: after I'm done here, sleepover tonight?

JAKE: Don't even ask, man. You know the answer!

[Amir laughs. He opens the DVD and puts it into a laptop to watch it.]

AMIR: Whoa! This is going in so smoothly--

AMIR: --smoothly, it was, like, really smooth peanut butter. It was j-- you won't even believe how smooth it was, it was so sm-- yeah, so smoothly, it went in.

PAT: Yeah? Smooth, right. Really smooth. Yeah, I don't-- I don't believe it, because it's clearly broken, Amir.

AMIR: Okay, so it skips a little when you put it in. I mean... just go to the next scene! What's the Biggie fries? Right, Jake?

JAKE: Cassels, d'you wanna know what really happ--

AMIR: Aaaaaah. So...

JAKE: What's your plan?

AMIR: What?

JAKE: You're just-- you're gonna do that every single time I try to talk--

AMIR: Aaaaaaaaaah.

JAKE: --for the rest of my life? Okay. You're not gonna be next to me forever.

AMIR: Why not?

JAKE: [sigh] Okay, here's what happened:
