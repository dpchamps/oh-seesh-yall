INTRO

A: [bleep] mother [bleep] Jake and Amir.

J: Try one without cursing.

A: [bleep] NO.



[Jake opens a can of Coca-Cola, with Amir peering over his computer watching him do it]

A: Whoa. Awwwww...

[one cut to Jake taking a sip]

A: You gotta give me a sip of that.

[another cut to Jake ignoring him]

A: You gotta give me some of that so-da.

[cut to Jake still ignoring him]

A: Gimme a sip of that so-da.

[another cut of Jake ignoring him]

A: [imitating Yoda] SODA SAYS GIMME A SIP, YOU WILL.

[Jake is STILL ignoring him]

A: C'mon, man, you gotta gimme a sip of that soda; I don't wanna ask twice.

J: You just asked me like 5 different ways, one of which was a TERRIBLE Yoda impression.

A: Yeah, not so TERRIBLE that you didn't recognize it was Yoda.

J: [shaking his head] That's not an accomplishment - DON'T write it in that book!

[cut to Amir holding a pen and book close to his face, looking slightly afraid]

J: [gesturing] Let me see your entry for today.

[Amir throws the book, Jake fumbles to catch it and fails]

A: Nice catch, Jay Buhner!

J: Nice throw.

A: What are you, a major-league right baseball player - 

J: [interrupting] Jake complimented my Yoda impression and then gave me a sip of his soda.

[Jake looks up at Amir, who shrugs]

J: You know you have the date wrong, right?

A: Yeah, but not so wrong that you didn't recognize -

J: [interrupting] June 43rd, 1.

[Jake glares at Amir, who makes a silly face and shrugs]

J: [closes book] Why do you even keep a diary?

A: [angry] IT'S NOT A DIARY. It's a journal. Now, gimme my diary back, please. 

[Jake hands it over, Amir snatches it]

A: Now gimme a sip! I gave you a diary, you give me a - 

J: [interrupting, angry] There's free sodas, okay? There are free sodas, in the kitchen, 20 feet away.

A: What do you want me to do, man? You want me to just...move?

J: Move there? Walk there.

A: [starts speaking after Jake says 'move there'] Yeah, you want me to just tele - heliport.

J: Heliport's not a thing.

A: It's a thing. You go -

J: [interrupting] Teleport is the word you were looking for.

A: [puts both hands in the air] Gimme a sip, man.

J: [irritated] I'm busy, okay? Doing ACTUAL WORK. So can you stop bothering me?

[Jake puts on headphones and starts singing Firework by Katy Perry and dancing. While he's distracted, Amir gets a long straw and puts it into Jake's can of soda and starts drinking it, but knocks it over onto Jake's lap]

J: [takes off headphones] Come on! What are you doing? What is that, a straw?

A: What are you, impressed?

J: NO. Don't write that down. 

[cut to Amir with the pen and book close to his face again, looking slightly afraid]
