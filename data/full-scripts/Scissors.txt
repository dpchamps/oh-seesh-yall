Jake and Amir sit across from each other at their desks. Amir is playing with open scissors in his hair.

Amir: Jake. Have I asked you my one question today-

Jake cuts in before Amir is done.

Jake: Just ask it.

Amir: E equals M C two. What's that about? 

Amir cuts his hair with scissors.

Amir: Ah. Did you see that?

Jake: No, do it again.

Amir: I was like scratching my head, right? And then I just went like-

Amir cuts his hair again.

Amir: -like that. Look, look at this.

Jake looks amused.

Jake: Yeah. Not bad.

Amir: I didn't know scissors could cut hair. What should I do?

Jake: Um, I guess even it out. 

Jake grabs the front of his hair.

Jake: I think you just have to take that front chunk.

Amir mirrors Jake's demonstration.

Amir: This?

Jake: Take the front chunk. Sarah come here.

Sarah comes over.

Jake: And uh, you just have to even it out, just take it all.

Sarah: Did he cut his hair with that scissors thing-

Jake: Scratching thing.

Sarah: -scratching thing.

Amir: I'm gonna cut just a little.

Jake: No I think you, it's really uneven. You gotta go-

Sarah: Farther down.

Jake: Yeah.

Amir: This is a lot.

Jake: Yeah, it's not as much as you think it is.

Sarah: It's gonna look good.

Amir looks at Jake.

Amir: I trust you.

Jake: I know.

Amir cuts the large chunk in the front of his head that Jake told him to.

Amir: It's so tough.

Jake and Sarah smile.

Jake: Just work through it.

Sarah: It's gonna look-

Jake: It's gonna look ace!

Sarah: -yeah, it looks great.

Amir holds up the chunk of hair he cut off, looking worried.

Jake: There you go.

Amir: This seems like a lot.

Jake: It's not that much. It's honestly not as much as you think.

Amir cuts more off.

Jake: There you go.

Amir: I mean, look at this.

Jake looks at Sarah.

Jake: Girls are really gonna like that, right?

Sarah: I, I love it.

Amir looks at Sarah.

Amir: I don't care what you think. I care-

Amir points the scissors at Jake.

Amir: -right? 

Jake: I think-

Amir: I have one best friend. It feels like a little too short to me, but I'm gonna keep doing it because I respect you and know that you wouldn't knowingly hurt me. Just like I've never knowingly hurt you.

Jake and Sarah pause.

Amir keeps cutting.

Jake: Amir...get the back.

Amir: Done! Boom.

THE END.
