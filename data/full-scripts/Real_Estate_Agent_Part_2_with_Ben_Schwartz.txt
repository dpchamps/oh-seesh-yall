[Clips from the previous episode.]

CAPTION: Previously On "Jake and Amir"

AMIR: I got us an amazing real estate agent, who will find us an amazing apartment!

BEN SCHWARTZ: My name is Cherry Dude!

AMIR: We don't want to live in a muffin!

BEN: I do have one other listing, but it is absolutely terrible.



INTRO

BEN: Welcome to Part Two of Juke and Aboot!

[Amir chuckles.]

JAKE: "Juke and Aboot"?

AMIR: It's close enough.



[Jake, Amir, and Ben enter a very nice apartment.]

BEN: I can't believe we're even in this place. Look at it. It's a dump. [sarcastically] It comes with all the furniture... ugh, and do you smell that? You might want to clog your nose. It smells like fruit.

JAKE: ...It smells great.

BEN: Well, if you love the smell of this, I got a muffin on Fairfax that'll drive ya wild!

AMIR: We don't want to live inside of a muffin.

BEN: Can we leave, please?

JAKE: Let's move on. See the rest of this place.

[Jake puts his hands on Ben's shoulders. Ben pushes them off.]



BEN: Another one of the countless things wrong with this place: the TV doesn't even work. [cut to reveal that he's referring to a Foosball table] It's all in black and white, and it only plays soccer.

JAKE: This is a Foosball table.

BEN: [doing a British accent] Whatever you call it in England, Your Majesty!

[Ben jabs Jake in the crotch with one of the bars of the table.]

JAKE: Ow!

[Jake jabs him back.]

BEN: [dreamily] Ahhhhhh...

[Ben jabs Amir in the crotch. Amir cackles.]

BEN: Wipeout! ...Please say we're done.

JAKE: Let's move on!

[Ben groans loudly in exasperation.]



[Jake, Amir, and Ben all sit down on a bed. Ben's hand is where Jake sits down.]

JAKE: Oh! In me!

[Ben pulls his hand away, licks his finger, then licks Jake's chest.]

JAKE: Ah! On me!

BEN: Here's another guest bedroom, but what's the point of having a bed in a room?

AMIR: Thank you!

JAKE: You're a bad realtor, man.

BEN: And you're a bad boy! [reaches over at Jake, infringing on his personal space]

JAKE: Ugh, get off me! When did you get your license?

BEN: Hmm. [counting on his fingers] I mean honestly, I can't even count--

JAKE: Just tell me the year.

BEN: No. I don't know how to count.

JAKE: Ah.

BEN: I don't know how to count. But, let's all get up! Three, two, heel!



[Jake, Amir, and Ben are in the home theater.]

BEN: And here, we have your own personal movie theater, but what's the point of jerking off in a movie theater if strangers aren't like "Hey! Hey, this is Frozen! Stop doing that! Cool dick, dude!"

JAKE: Did anyone say that second part?

BEN: Moving on.



AMIR: Whoa, that toilet felt great! It was like a massage chair.

BEN: S-- you know what, I think you probably just took a shit on the masseuse.

AMIR: Oh, no.

BEN: Yeah. Did he talk?

AMIR: Yeah, yeah.

BEN: Different language?

AMIR: Mm-hmm.

BEN: Was his name Sven?

AMIR: [simultaneously] Sven? Yeah. Damn it.

BEN: I can't believe he just let you shit on him... here we go. [leaves]

AMIR: That's so dumb of me.

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: Even for me. That's dumb.



BEN: So, we have seen apartments today; do we know which way we are leaning?

JAKE: Yeah. I think it's pretty obvious.

BEN: [open-mouth chewing as he talks] Yeah. I think so.

AMIR: Agreed.

JAKE: Yeah.

BEN: No need to say it!

AMIR: Mum's the word! We're all on the same page.

BEN: We know which one to get!

JAKE: I think so too.

BEN: But just in case, should we say it?

AMIR: No.

BEN: Don't need to.

AMIR: Don't need to.

BEN: 'Cause we got it.

AMIR: Exactly.



[Cut to a muffin sitting on a square of artificial turf. Jake and Amir can be heard, presumably from inside the muffin.]

JAKE: Are you fucking serious?

AMIR: I know! How amazing is this blueberry sun roof?

JAKE: It's bad!

AMIR: It's fun! It's--

JAKE: It's fun?

AMIR: It's friendly; it's different.

JAKE: To live here, in a muffin?

AMIR: Then get out! If you don't want to live here, get out.

JAKE: Fine. Bye.

AMIR: Aaaaaah. Don't go anywhere.

JAKE: Where's the door? It's a muffin.
