(Jake is in a stall using the bathroom, Amir is in the next stall)

Amir: Jake!

Jake: Oh my god. Two questions: why and how?

Amir: Two answers: red and twelve.

Jake: Ok, those are two answers, just not to those questions.

Amir: I mean, what do you mean how?

Jake: How did you know it was me? I took off my shoes so you wouldn't see.

Amir: That's stupid, like I don't know your socks.

Jake: (sighs) Then I guess why.

Amir: I thought you said 'meet me in the bathroom.'

Jake: No, I told Pat that I was going to the bathroom, and I asked him to tell you not to come.

(Pat enters bathroom, rubbing his arm)

Pat: Sorry, Jake. You were right. He's a lot stronger than he looks. Wait, he's not in here, is he? (leaves)

Amir: Anywho, what's taking so long?

Jake: (grunts) Do I have to answer that? 

Amir: All I'm saying is when I do it, it comes out like a rocket. One and done. Three wipes, eh eh eh, no matter what.

Jake: God, that's disgusting.

Amir: Still smells like roses in here. Is that you?

Jake: Shut up.

(Amir rolls toilet paper to Jake's stall with 'Jake' written on it)

Amir (pops out underneath Jake's stall) Jake!

Jake: Ah!
