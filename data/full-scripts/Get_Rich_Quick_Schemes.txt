INTRO
AMIR: When I say "Jake", you say "Amir"! Jake!
JAKE: Don't do this.
AMIR: Ass.
[Amir sits down beside Jake on the couch, holding a notepad. Throughout the episode he sounds out-of-breath to the point that his voice is raw or cracking.]
AMIR: Okay! Ever heard of a get rich quick scheme? Well these are wet bitch thick creams; ninety-nine ways guaranteed to get us paid ASAP! [laughs maniacally]
JAKE: So they are get rich quick schemes.
AMIR: What?
JAKE: You said they were "wet bitch thick creams"--
AMIR: "--ick creams", yeah! [laughs] Okay, number one--
JAKE: What is wrong with you right now? Don't yell; catch your breath.
AMIR: ...Asshole.
AMIR: What if we sell gift certificates that you have to accept at any store?
JAKE: That's just money.
AMIR: Yeah, exactly! We sell cash, for pennies on the dollar! [rubs his fingers together]
JAKE: That means you lose money.
AMIR: But ya gain pennies! [rubs his fingers together again]
JAKE: You have to chill out, okay?
AMIR: You know how people love juices and smoothies and shit?
JAKE: I guess.
AMIR: Okay, so we get a paperclip, put it in a smoothie, drink it, die, and sue the Jew that sold it to us!
JAKE: That's not where I thought you were going with that--
AMIR: Well keep up, Jakey! 'Cause my mind's racing at m--
[Amir stops, chokes, and coughs up a lot of blood into his hand. Then he begins laughing.]
JAKE: Oh my God! T--
AMIR: [as trying to speak over Jake] Okay, okay, okay--
JAKE: I'm not talking.
AMIR: --why rob people-- why rob people, when you can change your name to Robert People? [extends his hand] "Hi, I'm Rob People! Pleased to meet ya!"
JAKE: How does that get you money?
AMIR: "D'ahh, don't call me that; call me Rob! Mr. People's my dad's name." [laughs]
JAKE: I didn't call you anything.
AMIR: Why don't me and you, we open up a frickin' pottery store, huh? How's that sound? Some choice pieces at first, but then we'd build up our inventory, start franchising some stores?
JAKE: How is that a get rich quick scheme? Sounds like that would take years.
[Amir puts his hand on Jake's shoulder.]
AMIR: That's the first smart thing you've said today.
[Amir has his arm around Jake so tightly that he's pressing his cheek against Jake's shoulder.]
JAKE: Don't touch me, dude. I'm dead serious right now.
JAKE: Why are you this out-of-breath, by the way? I mean, like... you look like you just ran a ten-K.
AMIR: I'd like to run a 401(k)! Your frickin' retirement fund for a price, but first, [pats Jake on the stomach] how'd you like to open up a pottery store with me?
AMIR: Ever heard of a nutritionist? Well I'm an oldtritionist! Pay me to eat a weed!
JAKE: That cannot be on your--
[Jake glances at Amir's notepad.]
JAKE: --list. There it is. "Pay me to eat a weed."
[Amir is coughing large amounts of blood into a tissue.]
JAKE: You okay, man?
[Amir nods.]
JAKE: You want me to call a doctor?
AMIR: Call a doc-- Call a lawyer! I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!
AMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!
JAKE: That's actually really smart--
AMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis! [laughs] I knew you'd shit on it! [laughs] Isn't your face redder than a beet! ...Speaking of beets, [puts his arm around Jake] do you got a garden? I'd love to eat a weed.
[Amir is slumped down on the couch, holding the bloodstained tissue.]
JAKE: Want to take a break?
AMIR: Yeah, great idea. Let's take a-- let's take a hard five, go outside, get some fresh air, come back in here with a renewed sense of purpose to tackle the second half of the list--
JAKE: Alright, I'm gonna take you to the hospital--
AMIR: Please do, [chuckles] 'cause at this point in time, I believe that I am, uh... [clears throat] dead.
