INTRO

AMIR: THIS IS JAKE AND AMIR! WELCOME TO THE THUNDERSHOW!

JAKE: Not our intro.

AMIR: Dangit!



GARY: Guys, what's up?  I'm Gary Vay-ner-chuck and Ricky hired me to help you guys explode College Humor's traffic.

AMIR: Who are YOU?

GARY: I said, I'm Gary-

JAKE: (to Gary) Okay, you wanna see something impressive.  (to Amir) Who's Ricky?

AMIR: I know the name.  I know the name.  I just can't put the face to the-

JAKE: What name?

AMIR: I don't know the name, I don't know...who are YOU?

GARY: Wait wait wait, okay.  Are you guys on Facebook?

(At the same time)

JAKE: Yes     AMIR: No

GARY: Twitter?

(At the same time)

JAKE: Yup     AMIR: No

GARY: Ustream?

(At the same time)

JAKE: Yes     AMIR: No

GARY: Friendster?

(At the same time)

JAKE: No     AMIR: Yes

GARY: Are you guys active at all?

AMIR: Sexually?

JAKE: We use all those sites.

AMIR: I'm not active, sexually, or otherwise.

JAKE: Ok, he's not talking about sex.

GARY: Actually, I am.  You know, a healthy lovelife really impacts the workplace.

AMIR: Me and Jake f**k like rabbits, sir.

GARY: Woahhhh

AMIR: Not each other.

JAKE: And we don't do that.

GARY: Alright guys, here's what we need to do to make CollegeHumor go huge:  You need to hustle, crush it, and go big.

JAKE: Those all kinda sound like the same thing.

GARY: They're not.  Hustle is to crush it.

JAKE: Wasn't crush it the second thing?

GARY: No, that was go big

JAKE: Then the third thing was...?

GARY: Crush it

AMIR:  Crush it.  See?  This is...now you're speaking my language!  

GARY: Thank you, comprende.

JAKE: Comprende?

GARY: Jake, the number one thing is to respect your co-worker.  It's family. 

AMIR: It's family.

GARY: You guys are friends, right?

AMIR: Yes, best!

JAKE: Well, maybe.

GARY: Take Amir to a water park, an arcade, a picnic.

AMIR: I've always said that you should take me to a water park, an arcade, and a picnic.

JAKE: You have always said that, yeah.

AMIR: In one day, please.

GARY: I-I-I think Amir's cousin, Leron, runs a laser tag in Queens.  Why don't you guys go up there and laser it up?

AMIR: For once.

JAKE: How is that gonna help traffic?

AMIR: You're obsessed with traffic!!

GARY: Jake, Amir's right.  Don't worry about the traffic.  Become best friends.  Family.  And it will all work itself out...or not.

JAKE: So you're saying, it's a good idea for the site if me and Amir go to your favorite clothing store - 

JAKE and AMIR: Talbots

JAKE: and uh, we get just matching pajamas.

GARY: Dude, now you're getting it.

JAKE: I am, I think I'm really getting it. Ricky didn't hire you.  Amir hired it.

(cut to Gary's chair spinning emptily)

AMIR: (sharp breath in) He's gone.

JAKE: No, he's under the table.

AMIR: No...oh he, no, I can't see him.

JAKE: Right there.

(Amir is waving down with his pen)

JAKE: You're waving him down.

AMIR: No, I'm not...I'm stretching my wrists.

(Jake gets up to leave)

AMIR: Where you going?  What about the water park?
