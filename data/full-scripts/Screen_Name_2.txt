AMIR: Hey, does chicken ever go bad?

JAKE: Yeah, well it--

AMIR: Like does it spoil?

JAKE: How cold is your fridge?

AMIR: Uhh...fridge...

JAKE: OK, then yeah, it's really bad. Knowing you it's probably very-

AMIR: Yeah, I-I won't try to make my own nuggets anymore, that was a, especially out of salmon. 

JAKE: Yeah, ugh-

AMIR: That's stupid.

JAKE: -that's very gross.

AMIR: Will you just come over here and help me change my AIM screen-name already?

JAKE: Why are you getting impatient with me? This is the first time you've asked me. 

AMIR: Oooh-

JAKE: OK

AMIR: -I thought I asked you this morning, but I was just thinking it (chuckles) and I waited.

JAKE: So you just waited 8 hours to re-ask me?

AMIR: Yeah, probably more. (laughs) Will you help me? I already thought of a screen-name, all you have to--

JAKE: Oh my god! It smells terrible over here.

AMIR: Releaks, Jesus, it smelled fine two hours ago.

JAKE: What did it smell like before that? 

AMIR: Uh, honestly, it smelled a lot like my salmon, that's what I got.

JAKE: I think that's what I'm smelling, actually. 

AMIR: All right, just, I already thought of a name, all you have to do is help me out.

JAKE: What is it?

AMIR: . . . it's jakeandamir. --

JAKE: (mumbles)

AMIR: (mumbles louder) --OK, just chill for a second, you're not the 'Jake' so you don't have to get all--

JAKE: I seriou--all right, fine.

AMIR: --high and mighty . . . um, you're the Amir, so.

JAKE: Who's- and then who's the Jake if I'm the Amir?

AMIR: You tell me.

JAKE: I told you not to do that anymore, all right.

AMIR: (chuckles) Sorry. 

JAKE: Bye. 

AMIR: wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wait, OK, come back, relax, just . . . I don't know what this all is --

JAKE: All right, fine, open up your browser. 

AMIR: (laughs) I don't even know what that is. 

JAKE: I know, I know, here it is right next to the snood(?)--

AMIR: OK, I always wondered what that weird thi--

JAKE: Internet Explorer 6, huh?

AMIR: Yeah. 

JAKE: That's impressive.

AMIR: I wanted to explore the internet (beat) 6. So. 

JAKE: 6 ovah.

AMIR: (high pitched) sishovah. 6 over. 

JAKE: I got it. 

AMIR: OK, Faster.

JAKE: OK.

AMIR: wa-slow down, slow down, slow down. Slow down! Slow down!

JAKE: I'm done. 

AMIR: s-OK.

JAKE: Now pick a password.

AMIR: All right, uhhh . . . 

JAKE: Don't say Jake. 

AMIR: OK, so I don't know. 

JAKE: Um, maybe, this your pay stub? 

AMIR: Yeah.

JAKE: Use the last four digits of your social -- you make $120,000 a year. 

AMIR: That's too long for a password, isn't it?
