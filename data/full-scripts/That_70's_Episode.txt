INTRO Amir - (high pitched) It's Jake and Amir! It's Jake and Amir! (normal) It's--

Amir and Jake - Jake and Amir.

Jake - I got it. 

Amir - OK.



(Jake, Streeter, Pat, Amir and Dan are sat around the camera, That 70's Show style with the getting high scene, Amir seems to be the only one unaffected) 

JAKE: Man, Cheez-its are fucking good. 

STREETER: (chuckling) Have you ever had white cheddar ones, dude?

PAT: Nah, shut up!

AMIR: (fanning away smoke) I've had the white cheddar ones, I mean they're fine. They're just like- (coughs) They're just like regular Cheez-its. 

PAT: No, man, you made me forget what I was talking about, Amir. OK? Oh right, so Han has to go save Le-

STREETER: (laughing) Shut up, dude. No one cares! 

(Jake is laughing, Dan is just munching) 

AMIR: Smells like my uncle's car in here. 

STREETER: Guys, check it out. (impersonating Pat) I'm Pat, I love Yoda. (yoda impression) Get laid, I don't. 

AMIR: Ha, ha. I don't get it. What the hell is going on, you guys? 

PAT: Uh-oh. Someone didn't smoke enough. 

AMIR: Smoke, huh? So you guys are smoking drugs, then? 

DAN: (chuckling) Ha, he called the weed 'drugs'.

AMIR: (on cell) Hi, 911? Yeah, it's Amir. No, Jake's fine. However, my enemies appear to be smoking marijuanas. That's right, real marijuana, and you know what? Could you please a chopper or a car, but let me know which one because I want to know whether I should escort them to the lobby or the roof.   

(Dan takes off) 

JAKE: Amir, relax.

AMIR: Uh, no, they don't appear to be armed. Though I can't be sure . . . Hello?  Hello? (closes phone) OK, they hung up on me 3 minutes ago. 

PAT: Ugh, you're such a wiener, dude. Anyway, Han calls Chewbacca 'Chewy' because they're friends.

AMIR: All right, you know what, forget this! I'm going to McDonald's. 

PAT: Ooo, I could do that. 

STREETER: Uh, yeah.

JAKE: Yo, I could chow down on the D's right now. 

AMIR: Huh, all right. You know what, you guys are awesome! Let's go to McDonald's! And hey, tomorrow, the drugs are on me! 

(Dan is running by in the background)

DAN: We're all going to die!

THE END.
