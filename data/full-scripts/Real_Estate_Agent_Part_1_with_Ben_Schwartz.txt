INTRO

BEN: Hey, you're watching Adele Dazeem and Amir, on CollegeHabbaps.

JAKE: ...What?

AMIR: It's fine!



[Jake and Amir approach the front door of an apartment.]

AMIR: [sighs] So, I got us an amazing real estate agent, who will find us an amazing apartment!

JAKE: Awesome, man. What's his name?

[Ben Schwartz shows up, as real estate agent.]

BEN: Oh, my name?

JAKE: Jesus Christ.

BEN: It's funny you ask, 'cause I have a very ordinary name, and you've never met me before, so I can understand why you'd ask, so do you want to hear it?

JAKE: You shouldn't have to clarify--

BEN: My name-- here it comes --my name is Cherry Dude! ...Cherry... Dude!

JAKE: Nobody announces a name like that.

AMIR: [singing] Nobody does it better!

BEN: [joining in] ...it better!

JAKE: ...I hated that.

[Ben sniffs at Jake.]

JAKE: I'm gonna go.

BEN: [motioning for Jake to wait] I think you'll find that the door is locked.

JAKE: I'm outside, so, I'm good.

[Ben tries to open the door, but it is locked.]

BEN: Aaah. It's the door that I need to open!

[Amir laughs. Ben laughs back, then taps Jake in the nuts. Jake recoils in pain.]

BEN: Well! I will be back with a key, and a donut! Okay?

AMIR: [laughing] I told you he was the best!



CAPTION: 3 HOURS LATER

[Ben comes running back to the door, holding a donut but no key.]

BEN: [singing] Here I come to save the day! [laughs] Look what I brought.

[Ben mashes the donut into the doorknob's keyhole.]

JAKE: Did you forget the key?

BEN: I forgot the key!

JAKE: You ruined a donut.

BEN: I ruined a donut! [wiping his hands] I'll be back-- with a donut!

JAKE: With a key.

BEN: With a key.

JAKE: Key.

BEN: I'll be back with a key.

JAKE: Right?

BEN: Right.

AMIR: And a donut!

BEN: And--

JAKE: Just a key!

BEN: Oh, just a key this time!

JAKE: [to Amir] It confuses him.

BEN: It confuses us.



CAPTION: 19 HOURS LATER

[Ben comes running back again.]

BEN: This time I remembered... [holding up another donut] the key!

JAKE: It's a donut--

BEN: [mashing the donut into the keyhole] That's a donut. [sighs in frustration]

JAKE: God damn you.

[Ben blows into the upper keyhole, and gently opens the door.]

BEN: [singing] If you want to view paradise...

JAKE: What the fuck...? How did you do that?



[Ben guides them inside. There are tarps and a ladder by the entrance.]

BEN: Now I know you haven't eaten in the past twenty-four hours, but feast your eyes on this!

[Ben motions to the terrible-looking apartment.]

JAKE: Right, I know that's a joke, but I am very, very hungry.

BEN: Then feast your mouth on this!

[Ben holds out a muffin, and Amir immediately slaps it out of his hand.]

AMIR: We can't live in a muffin, you idiot!

BEN: Moving on!

JAKE: [to Amir] I would have eaten that.

BEN: Now let me give you a little info on the place. [As he speaks, he tries to put his arm around Jake, but Jake keeps fighting him off.] We're currently inside a five-bedroom, six-bathroom colonial townhouse, in Williamsburg, Virginia.

JAKE: Alright, can you stop doing that? We're not in a townhouse.

BEN: Okay, that's my fault. It's the wrong listing. [flipping through listings] Aaah! Here we are inside a blueberry muffin.

AMIR: What?

BEN: Is that wrong too?

AMIR: Yeah.

BEN: Okay, let's back 'er up. Aaah! [puts his arm around Jake's neck, pulls Jake toward him]

JAKE: Can--

BEN: We're currently inside a shithole in Crack City, USA.

AMIR: Oh, very cool!

BEN: Moving on! [laughs suggestively]



BEN: Do you guys like bathrooms?

AMIR: Uh, yeah!

BEN: Ohhhh, damn it.

JAKE: Why.

BEN: This place has zero bathrooms.

AMIR: That's okay.

JAKE: How do you shit?

BEN: What I do is I take a shot of moisturizer, and I get real wide, get over a toilet and go like this: [chanting] Hakuna matata. Haaaaaakuna matata! Nothing happens. That's just to scare it, to get ready. Cut to seventeen hours later: I'm in my bed, shittin' my balls off. Moving on!



BEN: I shouldn't tell you this--

AMIR: Oooooh, do it--

BEN: Okay, fine! Do you want to know who lived here before you guys?

JAKE: Sure.

BEN: Have you heard of a little band called the Rolling Stones?

AMIR: Uh, yeah.

BEN: Well, the serial killer who lived here loves the Rolling Stones. Played it while he killed people!

JAKE: Wait, a serial killer lived here?

BEN: Lives here. Moving on!

AMIR: Ooh!

JAKE: What?

AMIR: Whoa, a raven.



BEN: Oh, I forgot to ask you! Oh, no! Do you guys have any pets?

JAKE: No, we don't.

BEN: Ohh-ho-ho! Good, 'cause this place already has way too many pets.

AMIR: Where are they?

BEN: They're at work.

JAKE/AMIR: Work?

BEN: Yeah. Uh, you never seen a rat be a chef before?

JAKE: That was in a cartoon.

BEN: Yes! But a dog animated it.

AMIR: Moving on!



BEN: Just like the movie "Willy Wonka", the walls taste like things.

AMIR: [licking the wall] This one tastes like glue and paint!

BEN: [licking the wall] This one tastes like asbestos!

JAKE: How do you know what asbestos tas--

BEN: [yelling, trailing off] The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.



AMIR: So how much does this place cost?

BEN: Ten--

AMIR: Ooh!

BEN: --thousand--

AMIR: Aww.

BEN: -dollars--

AMIR: Ooh!

BEN: --a week.

AMIR: Aww.

JAKE: This place is disgusting.

BEN: Well, I do have two other listings.

AMIR: We don't want to live in a muffin!

BEN: I do have one other listing, but it is absolutely terrible.

JAKE: Then we're not gonna see it.

BEN: But there wouldn't be a Part Two if we didn't see it!

AMIR: Let's do it!
