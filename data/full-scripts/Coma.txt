Episode

(Sarah is crying)

Jake: What's wrong?

Sarah: Just got a call from my brother. My mom's in the hospital.

Jake: Oh my god. Is she okay?

Sarah: I don't know. She was—(Amir pops up behind Sarah and starts miming her story) she was gardening, and um—trying to reach a really 
tall branch or something—I don't know—and she like—she was on a ladder, and she just fell off the ladder onto the ground, and she, 
like, was unconscious for like five hours. No one found her. This car was driving by, like a total stranger, just like, saw her on the 
floor, and like, brought her to the hospital. Like, she was...

Jake: Horrible.

Sarah: She's unconscious, and she's not waking up, I don't know what's gonna happen.

Jake: Oh my god, you should go home.

Sarah: I can't, I have too much work. I don't know what to do.

(They hug, and Jake shoves Amir, so Sarah notices it)

Sarah: What are you—?

Jake: Nothing.

Sarah: I'm just so scared.

(Amir squirts lotion in his mouth and starts coughing; Sarah turns around)

Sarah: What the—?

(Amir bangs his head on the desk trying to get away)



(Amir is hugging Jake just like Sarah was)

Amir: It hurt more than it looked like it did, okay! Why did this happen to me! Why...

Jake: You're still covered in lotion.
