(Amir opens the blinds in the room and then jumps on Jake in bed) 

AMIR: (laughs) Jake.

JAKE: Come on. Ow!

AMIR: I yelled at your aunt. It's 6:15, it's 12:35 New York time.

JAKE: It's 9:15 New York time. 

AMIR: Whatevah.

JAKE: Not whatever. 



(Jake is brushing teeth in bathroom)

AMIR: What are you doing? You're on vacation! (chuckles) While we're out here, I ain't shaving, I ain't showering and I sure as hell ain't brushing. I might not even take a shit.  (high pitched) For real. 



(Jake is standing by the pool)

AMIR: Get the fuck away from that...water thing, I'm serious. 

JAKE: The pool?



(Jake is on the computer)

AMIR: By the way, Ricky is pi-ossed. He called me earlier and he was like, 'where the fuck are you, dude?'.  (chuckles)

JAKE: He's pissed at you. 

AMIR: What?



(Walking outside to the car) 

AMIR: Hey, where are we going now?

JAKE: My cousin's apartment. 

AMIR: OK, let me drive there. 

JAKE: OK, you are definitely not. 

AMIR: OK, let me drive there right now, or I'm going to go back inside and fuc--



(inside the car, Amir is behind the wheel)

AMIR: OK, what is 'R'? (car moves, Amir laughs) Whoa, oh my god, did you feel that? 

JAKE: Let me drive ri--



(Amir is driving on the highway)

JAKE: OK, so what is happening?

AMIR: STOP RECORDING, PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE WHEEL, I DON'T KN-I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE, THIS SUCKS! 

JAKE: I'll take the wheel if you tell--

AMIR: (lets go of wheel and shakes fists, yelling over Jake) I want to go home! I want to go home!  

JAKE: --me who should be driving right now. WELL HOLD ON TO IT! 

AMIR: (takes wheel again) OK, well, chill. Now you're making me nervous.



(Amir attempting to sing along with the song on the radio . . . poorly)

JAKE: Not close. Not even close at all. 

(continues to sing, cuts to Amir with hands off the wheel again, dancing)

AMIR: Jake, whoa! (takes wheel) Ah, watch- help me out, a little. 



(walking in a parking garage)

AMIR: (chuckles) Jake, it's like that episode of Seinfeld!

JAKE: Only not funny. 

AMIR: (laughs) With the jerking off, it's everyone's favorite episode.

JAKE: (over Amir) -And the wrong episode. Please! Just look around, does any of it look familiar? Do you see the car? 

AMIR: I already told you, I gave it to a valet, let's just relax.

JAKE: That's the first time you told me that because this place doesn't have a valet! 

AMIR: Ok, sheesh. Uh, relax, he was wearing jeans. He was super excited when I gave him the keys. 

JAKE: Yeah, I bet he was. The keys to my aunt's car, right? 

AMIR: One second. What color is it? White?



(walking outside)

AMIR: Jake, idea! 

JAKE: About how to get the car back? 

AMIR: No, better. I'm going to lay on the floor and you jump over me and I'll do it in slow motion.  It's going to look sick nasty! 

JAKE: Man, you lost the c--



(Approaching the In-and-Out Burger at night)

AMIR: (whining) What are we doing? It's late! 

JAKE: It's eight!

AMIR: It's late-thirty. 

JAKE: It's eight thirty and just relax, we're meeting my friends at In and Out.  

AMIR: What's that?

JAKE: It's-it's like McDonalds, just shut up, please. 

AMIR: Your friends better not be ass-tards.

JAKE: (to friends) Hey!

FRIEND #1: Hey! What's up man? How are ya? 

AMIR: (shakes friend's hand) Hey, I'm Amir. Jake's new best friend. (shakes Friend #2's  hand) Hi, I'm Amir, Jake's new best friend. (goes to third friend) Hey, Jake's new best friend. (fourth friend) Hey, Jake's new best friend. (back to Friend #2) Did I meet you before?

FRIEND #2: Yeah.

AMIR: Jake's new best friend.

FRIEND #2: Why he is here? 

JAKE: Can you--



(cuts to them ordering)

AMIR: Hey, sorry guys, one second, I need a word alone with my new best friend. (grabs Jake by head)

JAKE: Oh my god! 

AMIR: Hey, you said this place was like McDonalds, right? 

JAKE: Let go of my fucking head.

AMIR: You said this place was like McDonalds. So why did they just fucking laugh at me when I ordered Chicken McNuggets, huh? Huh?! 



(They're eating at a table)

AMIR: Fellas, guy walks face first into a bar, a metal bar. Ouch. (chuckles, no one laughs) All right, Jake, let's go. 

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Right now! ...I mean, I'm not asking you. 

JAKE: Yeah, you should though. You should at least do me do me that courtesy.

AMIR: LET'S GO N--!! 



(Amir is sleeping on table bench)

FRIEND #3: Is he really just asleep? That quickly?

FRIEND #4: That's almost impressive. 

JAKE: It's sad.

(they start throwing french fries at the amir) 

THE END.
