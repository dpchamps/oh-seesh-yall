INTRO Amir - One mississippi, two mississippi, three- (singsong) You're not hiding.

Jake - (singsong) Why should I be? 

Amir - (singsong) I don't know.



(Rosie and Jake are laughing)

AMIR: Jake, is Rosie annoying you?

JAKE: I'm fine.

AMIR: I can ask him to leave.

ROSIE: Come on, we're just playing Facebook wall roulette.

AMIR: How do you play? Explain it to me, like I'm an idiot, OK? Clearly.

JAKE: We just write random, weird things on our friend's wall as each other. So, like, um, here, come here.

(Amir goes over to Jake and Rosie but manages to sneak up from behind)

JAKE: Oh! My god.

AMIR: OK, so. 

JAKE: All right. Log in as you. 

AMIR: Password. Jake rules, with a 'Z' so a little hip or whatever. 

JAKE: It's not that impressive. OK, now I can sen-- You're only friends with me and Leron? 

AMIR: Well, yes, but I mean I was going to add more friends but I end up deciding against it because everyone rejected me.

JAKE: You decided against it or everyone rejected you?

AMIR: I'm sorry. Is the name of the game 'embarrass your friends'? 

ROSIE: Can I--

(Amir elbows Rosie in the shoulder)

AMIR: Come on, man.

JAKE: I'm just going to sign Leron's wall 'hey dude, I french kissed your dog'.

AMIR: Ah! Don't! (sighs) He's going to think it's me now. He hates when I do that. 

JAKE: Well, that's the idea, right? You signed up to play the game, there are no vetoes, all right, that's the beauty of it.  

AMIR: OK, fine. I'm going to log in as you now. 

ROSIE: He knows your password?

JAKE: I change it literally every day. 

AMIR: And I shall write on...Jaime's wall.

JAKE: No, no, no. No Jaime, not Jaime, not Jaime. 

AMIR: What the heck? You said that's the beauty of the game. 

JAKE: Veto. Veto.

AMIR: Th-there's no, no vetoes. 

JAKE: I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

AMIR: Really? (picks up tape recorder)

JAKE (on recorder): You signed up to play the game, there are no vetoes, all right,  that's the beauty of it. 

AMIR: So.

JAKE: Are you recording me all the time? 

AMIR: No. I memorize what you say the first time you say it. (laughs)

JAKE: OK, look, just not Jaime. All right? She was my first love, my first kiss, my first everything.  

AMIR: Not your first raspberry. 

(Amir tries to get to Jake's belly, ends up on top of Jake on the floor)

JAKE: Oh shit. Get the-- What the--

AMIR: Come on, here we go man. One time--

JAKE: No!

AMIR: Let me do this one time! One time! One bit--

(Jake grabs Amir's head and slams it against the underside of his desk a few times, Amir falls limp on Jake) 

JAKE: Ugh! Oh god, are you OK?

(Amir reaches for the tape recorder on the table and plays it)

JAKE (on recorder): I'm fine. 

THE END.
