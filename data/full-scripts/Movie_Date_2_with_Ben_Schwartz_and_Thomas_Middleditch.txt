JAKE: I don't know-
BEN (Sitting on top of JULIA's armrest, to JULIA): Hey, Deborah, I've got a question...
JULIA: Hey!
BEN: Did your head hurt?
JULIA: No, it doesn't hurt.

JAKE (To PENIS): Jesus Christ dude, if you're here then who's doing the Q and A?
(AMIR is now sitting in PENIS's old seat.)
AMIR: I shouldn't- BUT I DID!
JAKE (To PENIS): This is your movie, you should be up there right?
PENIS: Will you be quiet? I'm trying to listen to the Q and A. But I already got what I came here for. (To JULIA) Amir you say? Hmmm. Very interesting. (He gets out of his seat)
AMIR (Loudly): ...and that's what I call...
AMIR and PENIS: ...an ice cream social!
(BEN walks over, AMIR gets back up and returns to his seat)
BEN (Clapping): Unbelievable! Fantastic job. Now, does anybody else have any other questions?
PENIS: I have a question.
BEN (Shocked): What?
PENIS: Yeah, brother. (Shaking hands with BEN) It's for the lady. (To JULIA) Julie, will you marry me? (He pulls out a ring) Knowing full well that you will be used in the ongoing chess match that is the life between Amir and myself. (Quietly) You the pawn and me the queen.
JULIA (Without hesitation): Yes. Yes, yes I will!
PENIS (Giving JULIA the ring): Then you are my wife! Welcome to Hollywood, kid, you got moxie and I like it.
JAKE: I don't think that's official, you need a priest or something.
(BEN appears, wearing a priest costume)
BEN: I am a priest! Congratulations, you have been wedding-ed (pronouncing an H before W)
JULIA (To PENIS): I'm gonna give you so many babies.
PENIS: I'm gonna hit it. And everytime I hit it, I'm gonna think of Amir.
JAKE: No, I don't think that's the insult you want it to mean-
AMIR: Yes! It is.
(PENIS laughs)
BEN: I now pronounce you: man and wife (Pronouncing an H before W)
(PENIS and JULIA hold hands)
JAKE: Still not official-
BEN (Singing, throwing cinema snacks over everyone): Celebration!
(Simultaneously)
JAKE: Stop! Stop!
