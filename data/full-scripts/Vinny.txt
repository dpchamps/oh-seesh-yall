AMIR: Whoa! What color is that shirt? Tell me right now.

JAKE: I am not telling you, 'cause I know it's for that stupid log you're keeping of my clothes.

AMIR: You don't have to say anything, just tell me what color it is, please. 

JAKE: That's telling you, right?

AMIR: Purple or gray?

JAKE: I'm not saying.

AMIR: All right, I'm going to write down purple-gray; which is what I wrote down when you wore it 5 days ago! Little too soon to be wearing the same polo, isn't it, Jakey-boy?

JAKE: Don't call me that.

?VINNY: Hey Jake, do you know anyone--?

AMIR: Hey, Vinny! (eye roll) 

?VINNY: Hey, dude. Uh, do you know anybody who might be able to P.A. for me this weekend? I know it's short notice. ?

JAKE:  Yeah, I don't know, actually.?

AMIR: Yeah, I don't know either, why you're asking him and not me, because I'm the guy who gets shit done around here. ?

VINNY: Oh, do you know somebody?

AMIR: What do you need?

VINNY: Something really simple, it's like basic talking head set up, like something - somebody-?

AMIR: For sure.?

VINNY: -who can pick up a cube(?) truck-?

AMIR: Yeah, cube-?

VINNY: -load some pelican cases-

?AMIR: The cuber the better.?

VINNY: -probably like, you know, do a little bit of AC work-?

AMIR: Yes.?

VINNY: -like some pull focus-?

AMIR: I know, pull focus. They'll pull it as hard as you want.

VINNY: -little bit of racking--?

AMIR: That's fine, yeah, I have the guy, that's good.?

VINNY: Oh, cool! What's his name??

AMIR: His name is Vinny, like you, and his last name is Jake.

?JAKE: Like me.

AMIR: Like- Yes, right. Vinny Jake. ?

JAKE: So Vince, Jake, combined. ?

AMIR: Yeaahh, it's a coincivince.?

VINNY: Uhh, OK, w-what's his e-mail?

?AMIR: Uh, he'll call you, how about that? He'll fucking call you. So great. Problem solved! You can leave! ?

VINNY: OK. 

?AMIR: (with lips) Pah. Pah. Pah. Buh-bye. B-bye, roll away faster next time, when someone does you a favor, right?

JAKE: Uh, QQ.  

AMIR: Wha?

?JAKE: What does P.A. mean??

AMIR: It doesn't matter. (laughs)?

JAKE: It does matter, because you just lied to Vince.  

?AMIR: Well now he respects me.?

JAKE: OK, he respects you for 24 hours until he finds out you were lying to him. ?

AMIR: That's 24 hours longer than he'll respect you, so. 

?JAKE: OK.?

AMIR: (sigh) I don't even know why we're making a big deal of this and not talking about what type of JEANS YOU'RE WEARING RIGHT NOW!! 

THE END.
