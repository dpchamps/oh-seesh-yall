INTRO  Amir - Hey, you are watching Jake and Amir and a loser says what?

Jake - You're a loser.

Amir - What? ...No, wait! 



JAKE: (on cell) No, trust me, Mr. Lanzo, it will not happen again, I--

(Amir tackles Jake onto the floor, Jake is on his back and Amir has him straddled)

JAKE: Ow.

AMIR: You mean, ouch. 

JAKE: (sighs) You tackled me. 

AMIR: Yeah. Our bodies are now the same, our souls however, have switched. Haven't you ever seen Freaky Friday?

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Incorrect! I have, so thus, you have. You saw it at a Best Buy.  You cried at the end. 

JAKE: I was on the phone with my landlord. 

AMIR: My landlord. 

JAKE: And I might get kicked out of my apartment. 

AMIR: My apartment. 

JAKE: So I need to call him back, right now.

AMIR: Call me back . . . later.

JAKE: OK, that one didn't even make any sense. 

AMIR: Hm, blame yourself, I'm you. 

JAKE: If you're me, then what's my ATM pin number?

AMIR: 5559

JAKE: SHHH-All right. Fine. 

(Pat is seen overhearing and scribbling it down)

JAKE: What word can I never pronounce correctly?

AMIR: High-archy. 

JAKE: Hierar-har...

AMIR: ki-ki.

JAKE: Uh, yeah. Fine. What was my first pet's name? 

AMIR: Lady. 

JAKE: INCORRECT! 

AMIR: The tadpole?

JAKE: Oooh, yeah, Lady.

AMIR: I'm surprised you didn't remember that, me. 

JAKE: What?

AMIR: I knew this would work. Jamie Lee Curtis has never lied to me!

JAKE: OK, get off of me or I'm going to start hitting you.

AMIR: Do it. It'll just hurt you.

(Jake starts smacking Amir's face)

AMIR: Heh-heh, stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting your--

(Jake smacks himself) 

AMIR: Ow. (pause) I mean, ouch. 

(blackout)

(Pat is withdrawing money from an ATM)

PAT: Bingo! (makes call on cell) Hey mom, I'm just calling to let you know that I am going to pay my own rent this month be--Oh, hey Brian.  Uh, can you put my mom on?  Why are you answering her phone?  Uh-huh, yeah, uh, just put my mom on, please. Thank you.  (pause) Hey mom, why is Brian answering your phone?  Uh-huh.  I-I just don't understand, I don't- yeah, it's really early there isn't it?  Anyway, um, I'm calling to let you know I got my own rent money this month, so don't bother send--  No.  What do you mean 'how I got it'? I earned it. Whatever. I got a job, I don't know.  I got paid. What do you-- I didn't -- Yeah, I stole it, mom.  I stole my friend's ATM--  Yes, you did say something about ATM, didn't you?  Did Brian just call me a thief? I heard him in the background. 

THE END.
