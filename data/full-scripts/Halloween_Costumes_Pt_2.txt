INTRO
AMIR: I vant to suck y--
JAKE: You're watching Jake and Amir.
AMIR: ...Ass!
[Jake is sitting on a couch. Amir comes in, dressed as Psy.]
AMIR: Oppa Halloween Style!
[There is a long, awkward silence. Amir and Jake then begin talking simultaneously.]
AMIR: How do you not love me? How am I not adorable in this? / JAKE: Get out. Get out! Get out!
AMIR: [dressed as Supermen, pointing into the distance] It's a bird! It's a place! No, it's Superman!
JAKE: "It's a bird, it's a place"?
AMIR: It's Superman.
AMIR: [in the Psy costume] I'm so serious, man. Oppa leads, like, a Halloween-style Gangnam life and you have no love for it? Like... how is that good for Oppa?
JAKE: I don't care what's "good for Oppa".
AMIR: Oppa sad. Alright? Oppa leads a... a sad-style life.
JAKE: Yeah?
AMIR: Yeah, he really does.
JAKE: Yeah?
AMIR: [in a Ben Franklin costume] I have a dream...
JAKE: That's a Ben Franklin costume, man.
AMIR: What? No, I thought this was George W!
JAKE: You crammed so much wrong into so few words.
AMIR: ...Thank you.
JAKE: How do you think that's a compliment?
AMIR: [in a zombie costume] Do you know why I like to eat brains?
JAKE: ...'Cause you don't have one? 'Cause your idea of cool is either mean-spirited or dumb, and deep down, you probably hate yourself more than anybody hates you?
AMIR: ...'Cause I'm a zombie!
[Amir, in the Superman costume, leans over to hug Jake.]
JAKE: Nope.
[Amir brings his arm outwards.]
AMIR: I'm stretching.
JAKE: You weren't.
AMIR: [in the Psy costume, laughing] Oppa... Oppa leads a suicidal-style life...
JAKE: Why are you laughing right now?
AMIR: Oppa is confused of himself.
AMIR: [in a skeleton costume] So this one kind of works as, like, a two-person costume.
JAKE: How?
AMIR: Skeleton guy, and, uh... whatever the hell you want to wear! [chuckles]
JAKE: How is that a two-person costume?
AMIR: Oh my God, you're calling me out on all my bullshit today. And I love you for it! [laughs, kisses Jake's head] What are you, on your period or something?
JAKE: You know, your crotch is bleeding.
AMIR: Aw, shit! Ass!
AMIR: [dressed as a giant hand making the "shocker" gesture, singing] Isn't she shocking, yeah!
JAKE: Why all the costumes?
AMIR: It's Halloween, ass.
[Amir is off-screen.]
JAKE: No! Are you insane? Go home; take that costume off right now! You're going to get shot!
AMIR: Jesus.
JAKE: Yes! Jesus! Exactly! Wipe it off! Shower!
AMIR: [in the shocker costume] Ass!
AMIR: [in a Psy costume with pirate accessories] Oppa Pirate Style!
JAKE: That's perfect. Go with it--
AMIR: N'yarrrrrrrr, sexy lady! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp! N'yopp!
[Jake grabs Amir's throat.]
