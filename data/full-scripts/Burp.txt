(Jake drinks some Coke and burps)

Amir: (Trying to imitate his burp) Aaaaahh.

Jake: What?

Amir: Uhhhh.

Jake: So you don't know how to burp?

Amir: Not. I can burp.

Jake: Alright. I honestly don't even care.

(Amir tries to force a burp, and throws up)

Jake: My...

Amir: You know when you burp and you throw up a little and you can taste it in your mouth?

Jake: Yeah.

Amir: Dinner tonight?
