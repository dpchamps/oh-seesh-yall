INT: Office

AMIR: (Sung to the tune of All You Need Is Love) All you need is love. Bram bram bram bram bram. All you need is love, love. Love is all you love. (Sung to the tune of What I Got) Lovin' is what I love. I said remember love. (Sung to the tune of Forgot About Dre) Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say but nothing comes out when they move their lips just a bunch of jibberish. Mother fuckers act like they forgot about LOVE. (Sung to the tune of Circle of Life) Love savanya vada vicia babou uhhmm zana hey yacha hey ya LOVE-

JAKE: Stop! Stop. Stop it.

AMIR: (Cover mouth) Whoa. Sorry 'bout that. Was I humming out loud?

JAKE: You were not humming.

AMIR: One day, when you're in love you'll know what it's like to be in it. (Confused look) Love. 

JAKE: So you're in love?

AMIR: Ugh, I didn't want anybody to know. I wanted everybody to know. I'M IN LOVE.

JAKE: How long you've known this girl?

AMIR: Cosmically, it feels like we've been intertwined-

JAKE: How long though?

AMIR: It feels like forever.

JAKE: How many days?

AMIR: 7...4 if you're being technical.

JAKE: I'm being technical.

AMIR: 3, then. 2 if you don't count the day before we met.

JAKE: Why count that?

AMIR: Love. There are no rules. That's why it rules. (Weird voice) Bitch.

JAKE: You're a bitch.

AMIR: Whoa, what's with all the hostility?

JAKE: You just called me a bitch.

AMIR: You're so jealous. Are you gellin'?

JAKE: I'm-That's not what gellin' means and no, I'm not jealous of you, okay. You don't know what love is.

AMIR: Oh yeah? Well I know I'm constantly thinking about her, okay. And I'm constantly thinking of ways to make her happy 'cause she makes me happy. And the thought of her being with anybody else drives me crazy. 

JAKE: Okay, yeah.

AMIR: (Sung to the tune of What Is Love) What is love? Baby don't love me, don't love me 

JAKE AND AMIR: (Sung to the tune of What Is Love) no more.

AMIR: Don't sing along 'cause you're alone and I'm in love. And you're tainting it. 

JAKE: I'm not. 

AMIR: (Sung to the tune of What Is Love) Whoa whoa whoa whoa, oooh. Oooh whoa whoa-

(Jake is bobbing his head to Amir's singing)

AMIR: Don't even bob your head to it!

JAKE: Why wouldn't I-

AMIR: That's like singing.

JAKE: Why are you being like this right now?

AMIR: It's the same thing.

JAKE: Why are you yelling at me though?
