INTRO Amir - Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Catch Harold and Kumar 3D --

Jake - Oh, come on. 

Amir - --in theaters everywhere this Friday. What?



(Amir and Jake are inside a coffee shop about to approach the counter)

AMIR: It says employees must wash hands, OK? Employees. Last time I checked, I don't work here. 

JAKE: Yeah, I'm just saying it's a common courtesy and it's like hygienic so you should really do it.

AMIR: (to barista) Hey, I will have two Jack and diets and what do you want? 

JAKE: Nothing. You know, I'm going to go home--

AMIR: (gibberish over Jake) I'll have two Jack and diets, a vodka cran and what do you want?

JAKE: Chill out, OK? 

BARISTA: We don't serve alcohol.

AMIR: What is this? Prohibition? OK, just give me a shot, you bitch. 

JAKE: Hey! Hey, wow, really quick to start offending people, right? Sorry, especially because you didn't even ask for a shot to begin with. 

AMIR: OK, get this. I walked in here with an itty-bitty waist and a round thing in my face, OK? And you know I got sprung, so I wanted to pull up tight and--

JAKE: (to barista) Sorry.

AMIR: --I noticed that, what?

JAKE: I'm just going to have an iced coffee. Thank you. 

BARISTA: Sure. 

AMIR: By the way, the girl before us got two shots. Two. Don't think I didn't notice that.  

JAKE: OK, she got two shots of espresso. 

AMIR: OK. Whatever. I'll take it. Anything to take the edge off. 

JAKE: That's definitely going to put the edge on. You know, what are you even stressed about? 

AMIR: Taxes. 

JAKE: Do you owe them? 

AMIR: No, I just found out about them and it's kind of stressing me out.  Do you guys know what's up? OK, Uncle Sam doesn't even put lube on before he fucks us--

BARISTA: So, you want two shots of espresso, one ice coffee. Do you want room?

JAKE: Yes, please.

AMIR: I'll take that too. Actually make mine a room with coke. It's got to be 9AM somewhere. 

JAKE: Yeah, it's 9AM here.

AMIR: It's nickel beer night.

BARISTA: We don't serve beer.  

AMIR: Will you be my girlfriend?

BARISTA: Sorry guys, I have other customers.

AMIR: OK, you know what? We can pay with cash, credit or break dancing. 

BARISTA: We're cash only. 

JAKE: He's going to break dance. 

AMIR: (hopping about) Here we go. (throws himself on floor, change clattering everywhere, trying his best to 'break dance')

JAKE: (to barista, as Amir is still on the floor) Can I have your number?

AMIR: Oh. (popping up by Jake again, holding neck) Ahh, OK, hey. Cash is fine, unless you like that.

BARISTA: Cash is fine. 

AMIR: (to Jake) Do you have five dollars? 

THE END.
