Jake: I'm sorry dude, here. [Jake throws amir the bean bag]

Amir: Ha! It appears as though the mentor has become the mentee [A lot of loose change comes out of Amir's pockets as he gets up]

Amir: You see, what you don't get Jake is, when it comes to keep away the hand is quicker than the eye, Jeff!

[Amir throws the bean bag to Jeff, but it is caught by Jake]

Amir: Ok, I quit, forget it then, I don't wanna play.
