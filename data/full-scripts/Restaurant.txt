(Jake is talking to Sarah and Pat,telling them about what happened the previous night.)

Jake: You guys, listen to this. You know there's a McDonald's by our office?

Pat: Yeah.

(Flashback to Jake walking past McDonald's at night)

Jake: Ok, so last night I was walking home, right, and I see Amir.

Amir: I didn't know you were going to crash my dinner.

Jake: Sit down, please. What are you doing, dude? You're in your pajamas.

Amir: I live like a ten minute subway ride away, so...

Jake: So no shoes?

Amir: That was an accident.

(Cut back to the office, Sarah and Pat are laughing)

Pat: Seriously?!

Jake: I swear to God.

Sarah: Oh my god.

Pat: Unbelievable.

(Amir tries sliding under a railing to join Jake, Pat, and Sarah, but fails so they start laughing at him. He then continues to do weird dances, assuming they're laughing because what he's doing is funny.)

Amir: So funny.

Jake: It's insane. It's ridiculous.

Amir: Dinner tonight? Thinkin' 'The D's' (makes a big M with his arms)

Jake: (still laughing) That's an M.

Amir: What?

Jake: That's an M.

Amir: (as he's walking away) Yep.
