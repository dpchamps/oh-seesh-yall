[no intro]



[Jake and Amir are waiting for a table at a restaurant.]

JAKE: Hey!

HOSTESS (JESSICA): Hey!

JAKE: Uh, two please.

HOSTESS: Sure.

AMIR: Yup, two for dinner, heheh!

HOSTESS: Great!

AMIR: Though usually we just eat pussy.

JAKE: 'Later.

[Jake immediately leaves.]

AMIR: Wait!



[Amir is eating dinner by himself. He shakes his head about what happened. A waitress comes over.]

WAITRESS (CHLOE): How's the steak?

AMIR: Fine... though I think I need a martini after that whole exchange.

[The waitress chuckles politely.]

AMIR: Catch that?

WAITRESS: Yup. One martini comin' up!

AMIR: No: what happened with me and my friend? Best friend, actually. Or so I thought.

WAITRESS: Oh. No.

AMIR: He ditch-ditch-ditched me.

[The waitress goes to leave, but Amir holds her back by the arm.]

AMIR: Actually, one second. Where's the hostess? Let's call her over; she saw the whole thing.

WAITRESS: Let go of my arm... and I'll go get her.

AMIR: Fine.

[He lets go of her arm.]

AMIR: Actually, what's her name? I can just call her over.

WAITRESS: It's Jessica. I'll just go grab--

AMIR: Perfect. Jessica! Jessica!

[As Amir calls for the hostess, Jessica, he restrains the waitress by the wrist again. She tries to pull away.]

AMIR: You're... hurting my fingers, honestly.

[Jessica comes over.]

JESSICA: Are you okay?

AMIR: Jess! Hi. I was just telling, um...

[There is a pause, but not a very long one.]

AMIR: That's when you say your name, sweetheart. It's called flirting. [to Jessica] You saw when my best friend left, right? After I told that good joke?

JESSICA: ...Yeah.

AMIR: Look, I knew you thought it was funny, didn't you? For an off-the-cuff one-liner?

JESSICA: Um...

AMIR: Um what?

JESSICA: ...It was fine,

AMIR: [in a robot voice] It was fine... No it was not fine... It was good... [speaking normally] Okay, tell it like it is. All right? Obviously I wouldn't Tweet it. I have a very unpopular twitter account: USARice. Follow it if you scare! [imitating Dracula's iconic laugh] Moo ooo ahh ahh ahh...

[There is a long pause. Amir holds the Dracula face.]

AMIR: DO you honestly think he should have left, though? Over one joke?

JESSICA: Well, I kinda get the sense that you make those jokes a lot...

AMIR: Granted! Okay? But that's almost enough out of you, so please... proceed with caution.

JESSICA: Well maybe he was just fed up, and... didn't want to be here anymore.

AMIR: And that actually is enough out of you. Thank you so much, Jessica; you're trying to be nice, but you're giving me a legit migraine right now.

JESSICA: Well I also got the sense that he didn't want to be here to begin with, so...

AMIR: [mock laughter] It's my birthday today. [pause] Wow, suddenly the customer's always right! I'll have that martini for free now, and as for the steak, I think... no, in fact I know I'm going to be eating it off your ass.

[The waitress slaps Amir in the face.]

AMIR : Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Woo! Yeah! That's a lawsuit. That is a lawsuit. Good news, everybody! My name's Jake Hurwitz and dinner's on me, because this establishment now owes me a million dollars! In the form of a suit. [tugs his collar] Class action!

[The waitress begins crying.]

JESSICA: It's fine, Chloe. It's gonna be fine.

AMIR: Yeah, it's fine! It's fine? Or do I have a video tape... of the whole frickin' thing?

[Amir holds up his iPhone, which has a recording of him playing.]

AMIR: [on the iPhone] It's fine? Or do I have a video tape of the whole frickin' thing?

AMIR: Nooooo!

[Jake comes back to the restaurant.]

JAKE: Hey, man. I'm sorry. I cooled off. It's just I really hate when you make those jokes. You know?

[Amir nods.]

JAKE: What's going on? Did you make this girl cry?

AMIR: I made her realize that she was being a proud little diva tramp floozy!

[Jake slaps Amir in the face.]

AMIR: That's another lawsuit! That is another lawsuit, unbelievable! Two for the price of fun! I'm rich... James, bitch!
