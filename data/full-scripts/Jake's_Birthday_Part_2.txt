AMIR: OK, uh, just because nobody likes us doesn't mean we shouldn't go out strong tonight.

JAKE: All right.

AMIR: Hey, listen to me. Tonight is going to be - CRA-ZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY!!!



(They are in Jake's apartment)

AMIR: AAAAAYYYYYYY--

JAKE: Stop!

AMIR: Question. You haven't had a single McNugget yet.

JAKE: Yes, I have. 

AMIR: Let me finish! Why? 



AMIR: Somebody sauce me! Right now. 

JAKE: OK, can I have my phone?

AMIR: Nah, you are good. (high pitched) Tonight is about sans phone.

JAKE: (sing-song) Sans phone. Sans phone. 

AMIR: Tonight is sans phone, yeah. 



AMIR: Let me guess, you're sad. You know what? People at work suck shit. My birthday sucked and you don't see me crying about it. 

JAKE: Yeah, you're crying about it right now.

AMIR: (whining) Well it was depressing as hell, I was all alone! 



(party going on elsewhere)

GUY: Yo, where's Jake?

PAT: No idea, I called him like a dozen times. 

GUY: Oh, I think he's with Amir actually.

GIRL: Did you even invite Amir?

PAT: No, Jake hates Amir. Straight to voicemail. 



(back to Amir and Jake) 

AMIR: Who dat sick-ass dude with that fly ass gift? Who dat sick-ass dude with that fly ass gift?

JAKE: What is it?

AMIR: It's uh, whatever. It's, uh, anything you want it to be. 

JAKE: It's a condom holder.

AMIR: Boom. So.

JAKE: I didn't want it to be that. 

AMIR: OK, well why'd you put a comdon in it?

JAKE: Can I just have my phone, actually?

AMIR: Ah, come on. Why-

JAKE: Oh my god! Seventeen missed calls. 

AMIR: Seventeen?

JAKE: Ten text messages. 

AMIR: Proba-Those are all for me. 

JAKE: Nope. It's Pat. He says that everyone is at Cullen's.

AMIR: Heehee, yeah right. Pat's at the vet. He's probably just still trying to fuck with you. All right? Honestly, honestly, honestly, honestly-

JAKE: Honestly what?

AMIR: Hones-

JAKE: What?

AMIR: I'm going to kill him. 

JAKE: OK.

AMIR: Straight up.

JAKE: Straight up, I'm going to go to Cullen's. 

AMIR: Aye-waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwait-wait for me then. Let me just take a super-super-quick power nap. Super tired from all this pre-gaming. (high pitched) Supah tired from all this pre-gaming! Honestly...Jake.
