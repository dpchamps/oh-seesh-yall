Amir: Hey, you're watching JAAake-- (coughs) Sorry.

Jake: Wow.

Amir: Please delete this one. I'm begging you.

(Both sneeze in unison, Amir proceeds to mimic Jake)

Both: I know what you're doing.

That was just a coincidence!

You're clearly beginning to talk after I do!

I'm a huge nerd.

Amir: No I'm not.

(Jake makes Amir pour his water on his desk)

Amir: You're a jerk!
