INTRO:

AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and... me.

JAKE: So you forgot your own name?

AMIR: For like a second!



[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir is drinking a glass of water while plugging his nose.]

JAKE: It'll get easier.

AMIR: Ugh it's so clear and watery!

JAKE: Well it's water.

AMIR: Yeah, well that doesn't explain why it's clear, does it, ya dumb fuck!?

JAKE: Actually it does.

AMIR: Oh, gosh.

(Amir tries to hide what he's doing as he pops open a can of Coca Cola and pours a bit into the glass of water, but fails.)

JAKE: Ok I can see what you're doing.

AMIR: Yeah, and seeing is believing, so,, and then when you believe, not at the same time as you see,--

JAKE: Alright, you know what, never mind; I'm too tired for this today, man.

AMIR: Wanna know what to do?

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Drop a pencil, right? And when you go to pick it up, (tilts his head onto his palm and closes his eyes to mime sleeping) AEH!

JAKE: (imitating Amir) AEH! What's aeh?--

AMIR: AEH!--

JAKE: What is aeh!?

AMIR: Sneak in a quick nap!--

JAKE: Finish your-- finish your sentences!

AMIR: Sneak in a quick nap.

JAKE: That's a really really dumb idea.

AMIR: Yeah, well if it's so dumb I do it all the time, and.. nobody notices.

JAKE: Everybody notices.

AMIR: Impossible.

JAKE: You know sometimes you're down there for like three hours!

AMIR: Yeah, right, it's like a second.

JAKE: It seems like that to you because you're the one sleeping.

AMIR: Exactly!

JAKE: Exactly.

(Amir smiles at Jake, thinking he got him, but then his expression turns to confusion.)

AMIR: ......wat?

JAKE: Since you're asleep, time passes quickly for you, but to everybody else, it seems like a legit three hours.

AMIR: No...

JAKE: ...Yeah.

AMIR: (Putting his hands to his head in desperation) No. Oh, fuck me.

JAKE: You know sometimes you're down there just laying there like this with your eyes open! (putting his hands behind his head)

AMIR: Ok I'm relaxing!

JAKE: I know you're relaxing, we're not debating that.

AMIR: You know what, I can't have this conversation right now, okay? I'm tired.

JAKE: ..Fine.

AMIR: (looking down as if about to pick something up off the floor) Uhh, oops.

JAKE: You didn't drop anything.

(Amir is asleep, leaning back in his chair.)

JAKE: No more hiding under the desk, right?

AMIR: (sleep-talking) AHhnno.

JAKE: (to himself, since Amir is asleep) Okay.

END.
