INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!

JAKE: Okay, open the door! He farted in the booth.

AMIR: Lock the door, please.



[Jake and Amir are away from their desks. Jake has a sandwich. Amir is staring intently at him. Jake takes a bite. Amir keeps staring.]

JAKE: Do you want half of my sandwich?

[Amir shakes his head.]

JAKE: Okay, well, don't ask me to eat lunch with you if you don't have any food, at all. I keep telling you--

[Jake begins choking on a piece of sandwich.]

AMIR: You keep on telling me to [imitates choking noises]? Heheh, what is that?

[Amir chuckles as Jake struggles to breathe.]

AMIR: Heheheh! Come on, laugh! That's funny. I laugh at all your jokes, and trust me: they are not all winners.

[Jake is holding his throat, and still having trouble breathing.]

AMIR: Okay, what is this? [Amir copies the gesture Jake is making.] I never studied the universal symbols for stuff.

[Jake tries to respond, but can't.]

AMIR: How 'bout this: If you're really choking, spin around in your chair.

[Jake frantically spins around, then looks at Amir intently.]

AMIR: Nahhh. Not buying that! Not buying that at all. That's a fake spin; you're just spinning to make it seem like you're choking because I told you to spin.

[David comes in.]

DAVID: Jake's choking!

AMIR: No no, this is just a game we're playing, okay? And you're not invited. So leave.

[As David leaves, Jake claws at the air in an attempt to get his attention.]

AMIR: Sorry, it's just that if this isn't a goof, it should be me that saves you, not some... other loser, alright? Amir saves Jake. That's... that's the lead.

[Jake falls out of his chair. He slumps to the floor and stops moving entirely. Amir just shakes his head. Then Amir slides Jake's sandwich toward himself.]

AMIR: I'm gonna eat your sandwich... so if you're alive... better stop me...

[Jake lies motionless on the floor. Amir begins eating his sandwich.]

AMIR: Okay... great acting job. The best Actor... -Grammy... goes to... you! [pause] You didn't laugh at any of my jokes... and now I'm not gonna save yours. [pause] Um... [pause] Ummm... [impersonating Trump] You're fired! [pause] Hm. Wow... you know, I gotta hand it to you, man... didn't think you'd take it this far! Hm. Aah!

[Amir throws the bread from the sandwich at Jake.]

AMIR: You know what? Now I wish you are alive, because if you're dead, people are gonna blame me... and you're gonna feel... like a pony. [pause] Okay! This has been a dope lunch, thank you, but I don't deserve this star-treatment. So.

[Amir leaves Jake alone. Jake lies motionless on the floor. The only sounds are background noises of the office. Then Jake sits up.]

JAKE: Come on, did that really not look real?
