INTRO Amir - Hey, hey! I'm Jake and you're watching Jake and Amir.

Jake - You're not Jake. 

Amir - Why not??



(Jake and David are having lunch)

DAVID: All right, so I kick her in the mouth, and go 'here's the three dollars I owe you, the tooth fairy will give you fifteen, keep the change'. 

JAKE: Wow! That's awesome!

DAVID: There is blood everywhere, her teeth were all over the desk. 

JAKE: Ha! Dude, ex-girlfriends are the worst! 

DAVID: Bro, the worst! Come here! 

JAKE: There you go. You're a good guy, David. Do you know that? 

DAVID: Hey, call me Dave. My friends call me Dave. 

JAKE: Cool. All right, yeah.

DAVID: So I've got a question, guy to guy.  

JAKE: Uh-huh?

DAVID: What's the- What's the deal with Amir?

JAKE: Geez, man. He's so stupid. Why, what did he do to you?

DAVID: No, I like him. I think he's really funny.

JAKE: Me too. I like him. He's funny. We get along. Me and Amir like--

(Amir enters)

AMIR: Sup? 

JAKE: Not too much, dude. Just finishing lunch with the new guy, Dave. 

(Amir sits next to David)

DAVE: There he is. 

AMIR: Really? If you're eating lunch, then why is there no food on the table?

JAKE: I said we finished eating lunch.

AMIR: Finished eating lunch.  OK, that makes sense then.

(David laughs) 

DAVID: Classic. So good.

AMIR: (confused) I'm classic. Yeah, I'm so good. 

DAVID: So funny. All right guys, got a question, guy to guy to guy. 

AMIR: To guy. 

JAKE: That's three guys he said--

AMIR: Three guys. 

DAVID: What's the deal with Sarah? 

JAKE: What do you mean? 

AMIR: Jake is in lov--

JAKE: Lottery school! Jake is in lottery school. I'm in lottery school. 

DAVID: As well as being in love with her? 

(Amir and David laugh)

JAKE: (joins laughing) Yeah, I didn't cut him early enough, did I? Lottery school! 

DAVID: Yeah, I'm probably still going to go for her. 

JAKE: (laughs) . . . What?

DAVID: Yeah, I mean if you haven't tapped it by now, it's probably never going to happen so, you know, I'm going to dive right in there.   

JAKE: Wow, you are--

DAVID: Eat that right up. (chuckles)

JAKE: You're serious then? Cool.  

DAVID: Yeah.

AMIR: Yeah. 

JAKE: So you're uh, you're just going to go for it. 

DAVID: I'll probably show her my motorcycle, let her ride that thing. Girls get wet for that stuff!

AMIR: (laughing) You're thinking of a slip n' slide, but girl do get wet for that.

DAVID: (chuckles) Slip 'n slide. That good! How do you not love him? 

(Sarah enters) 

SARAH: Hey, Dave.

JAKE: HEY SARAH!

SARAH: Uh, did you guys eat lunch? 

AMIR and JAKE: Yeah.

DAVID: Nope. (tosses the bagel he was holding at Jake) 

SARAH: OK, do you want to go eat with me?

DAVID: Uh, let me think about it. F**k yeah. (to Jake) Come here. 

JAKE: Fine, whatever. 

SARAH: All right, let's go! 

DAVID: Hey, Sarah. Got a question for you, guy to girl. 

SARAH: Yeah? 

DAVID: What do you think about motorcycles? 

SARAH: Oh my god, are you serious?

(David and Sarah leave)

AMIR: (chuckles) My boy is getting frenched TONIGHT!
