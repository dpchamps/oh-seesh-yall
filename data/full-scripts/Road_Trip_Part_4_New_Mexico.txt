INTRO

AMIR: Bonjour you're watching Jaques un Ami.

JAKE: We're in New mexico!

AMIR: Oui

---

[Jake and Amir are somewhere in New Mexico. Music similar to Breaking Bad plays as they cook macaroni and cheese with spam.]

[Cut to: they are both sitting and eating.]

JAKE: How?

Amir: Easily how!

Jake: How?

Amir: Dinosaurs, better movie!

Jake: That doesn't make it a better movie than Jurassic park 1.

Amir: Yeah, every sequel is better than the original.

Jake: That's usually the opposite.

Amir: Oh, no... you're wrong. [Amir laughs for too long]

Jake: Easy with the laughing [giggles uncomfortably]

[Amir keeps laughing]

Jake: Yeah that's pretty good.

[Amir slams table in laughter]

Jake: Alright buddy [mumbles] let's stop

[Amir continues to laugh uncontrollably]

Jake: No, keep it down, come on its funny it's, it's pretty funny

Amir: What?

Jake: It's funny

Amir: It's really funny

Jake: Yeah

[Both sigh]

Jake: No, Yeah this is nice

[Amir starts to laugh uncontrollably again]

Jake: Yeah, pretty good... Please, ok... No this is nice, right?

Amir: I wish we could just live on the road or something

Jake: Man, me too

Amir: In fact, ok. Your wish is my command

Jake: What are you gonna--

[Amir swallows the RV key]

Jake: Oh no!

[Amir starts choking]

Amir: [Amidst choking] You're welcome, you're actually, quite welcome

Jake: Why did you do that!?

Amir: Now we're stuck together! Oh, I think the bitch went down the wrong pipe or something! Sideways wo be sure

Jake: You take every good thing, and you ruin it!

Amir: Cool it, alright [chokes] I've actually, I think I've lost my appetite

Jake: Yeah? You lost your appetite because you ate a key!

Amir: Easy Dr. Oz, you don't wear greed well

Jake: It's not greed

Amir Tomata, tomata

Jake: You can't ever be satisfied, can you? You're too much of an imbecile to realize that sometimes a moment is just nice. You don't have to over-extend yourself and cling to it like a loser. By the way, how does swallowing the key fulfil my wish of living a life on the road?!

Amir: I feel like we're not even having a conversation about a key anymore!

Jake: Of course!

Amir: I feel like this this this this shit has been brewing under the surface for over a Coons age!

Jake: Excuse you!

Amir: Absolutely excuse you!

Jake: I tried to make this trip fun for you

Amir: Trip fun?! I didn't even want to go to LA, I wanted to say in New York! Bitch

Jake: Yeah, well nobody wanted you there

Amir: No? I chose the city out of a hat!

Jake: Every single slip of paper said LA

Amir: Impossible

Jake: Why

Amir: Because everybody would have moved to LA

Jake: God you're dumb

Amir: You're gum!

Jake: I said dumb

Amir: So did I!

Jake: Tell you what man are you still granting wishes? I wish the trip was over, right now

Amir: Granted! [Tries to bring up the key by puking]

Jake: Gross

[Amir tries again]

Jake: Alright

Amir: One key, one wish, coming right up

Jake: Oh God, just--

[Amir throws up]

Jake: Oh bile

[Amir throws up again]

Jake: You're going to make me throw up!

[Both throw up]

Amir: Pussy!

[Jake starts gagging loudly]

Amir: Pah! Nothing!

[Both still gagging loudly]

Jake: Oh no! [incoherent speaking] It gotta be more than halfway down okay, you're going to have to shit it out

Amir: Good, Cant fickin' wait!... Coons age!

Jake: Stop it

[Cut to black. Wolves howl as the sun rises]

Amir: [in pain] Oh, oh oh oh owwww!

[In a shot of the RV, Jake exits wearing a hazmat suit, and Amir emerges from below the camera shot wearing only his underwear]

Amir: Alright, she's ready

Jake: So you're really not gonna do this yourself?

Amir: You have the key, you dig it out!

Jake: Imbecile! Ass!

CAPTION: TO BE CONTINUED...
