Amir: Hey. Dinner. Tonight. 8 o'clock.

Jake: Ah, no thanks. I'm pretty tired.

Amir: Ice cream? You want ice cream?

Jake: No.

Amir: Probably can't... probably can't get ice cream unless you finish your dinner.

Jake: Well, yeah. I said no to both, so...

Amir: Come on, man. Don't be some loser who stays at home.

Jake: Fine. Sorry.

Amir: I'm sorry, listen. I shouldn't have called you a loser. Let me come over, make dinner, we'll eat it together, I feel like a huge... I feel like a dick ever since I made fun of you.

Jake: Honestly, don't worry about it. Forget it.

Amir: Like I know you're just trying to be polite or whatever. I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

Jake: Take no for an answer. I don't want you to come tonight.

Amir: What's your favorite beer?

Jake: Listen, I just, I don't want to do anything tonight, but I'll answer your question; it's Stella. But don't come over.

Amir: Comin' over with a twelver of it.

Jake: Ok, you're not listening to me. I really don't feel like doing anything tonight. I'm sorry.

Amir: Come on, let's do something together for once.

Jake: Uh, god. I'm just really tired, I want to get home, I feel like shit. If you absolutely have to come over, then...

Amir: Sweet! I'll come over at 8. Vodka and Red Dogs. Ruff! Auuuuuu!

Jake: Do you mean Red Bull?

Amir: Yeah. That's how I do a bull, it's so weird. It's like 'ruff'.

Jake: But you also said dog.

Amir: ...... Ruff!

Jake: Forget it.
