[Jake, Amir, Sarah and Jeff are playing Monopoly in the office] 

Amir (rolls dice): Snake eyes, bitches! 

Jeff: It's not even your turn. 

Jake: And this is not snake eyes. 

Amir: Okay.

Sarah: Did you bring your own dice? 

Amir: Always bring your own dice, right? 

Jake: Never bring your own dice, take them away. 

(Amir blows on the dice in Jake's hand, Jake drops the dice) 

Amir: Ooh! Snake eyes, bitches! 

[Jump cut] 

Amir: Alight, am I the car, or the doggy wearing the hat inside of the thimble? 

Jake: Which one- Which one did you insist on being in the beginning? 

Amir: The dog-hat-thimble. 

Jake: Okay. 

Amir: But I don't know if we switch every turn. Like, sometimes I move the iron.

Amir (rolls dice): Chance. Whoa! Instant win. That's a pretty chill card. 

Jake (takes the card from Amir): Go directly to jail. 

Amir: Yeah right, ha! What did I do to deserve that? 

Jake: Well, you're eating my hotel right now, for starters. 

Amir (spits out a hotel piece): So right off the bat, okay, no more jail I'm thinking. And then, that's fine. 

Jake: Thinking, you are in jail. You roll doubles and you're out though, so it's not a big deal. 

Amir (spits out the dice): Whoa! Snake eyes! 

[Jump cut] 

Amir (moving his pieces): Whoa! St. James and a hotel. I will take it. 

Jake: I already own it. 

Amir: Oh, okay. So... 

Jake: So, that's $950. 

Amir: Or, what if I give you $20 real money, and - 

Jake: 40. 

Amir (giving jake money): 40. Okay.

Amir (pointing at Uncle Pennybags on the board): Jake, you look like this guy. laughs... Jeff, you look like this guy. laughs... Sarah- 

Sarah: Stop! 

Amir: Okay... You look like this guy though.. So... Who thinks I look like this guy?

Amir (laying down his cards): Full house ladies! Read 'em and weep-sauce. 

Jake (laying down his cards): Ooh. Four of a kind, so... 20.

Amir: Sheesh... What? 

Jake: That's $20. 

Amir (gives Jake $20): This game is so fun.

Amir: Alright, I'm gonna build a house on chance, and now me and Jake are neighbours. 

Jake: You can't do that. You can't- You can't own chance. 

Amir: That's beautiful. 

[Jump cut] 

Amir (moving his pieces): Ah sheesh, Boardwalk. 

Jeff: You owe me $2000. 

Amir (counting out bills): Okay, not a problem. 20, 40, 60- 

(Amir pushes the board around, throwing the pieces everywhere. Everybody else gets up and leaves) 

Amir: W-w-wait! Let's play Monopoly. 

Jeff: That was Monopoly! 

Amir: Was it?
