INTRO:

AMIR: Hey you're watching J-A-K---

JAKE: Say it!

AMIR: --Say it, I know, I'm going to.



[Jake and Amir are sitting on a couch, talking to the camera.]

JAKE: Hey guys, cool news. Me and Amir came out with a thirty-minute special, which you can watch now on CollegeHumor or Facebook for only three bucks, or you can buy the DVD today, by going to CollegeHumor.com/JakeAndAmirFired.

AMIR: That's right, and all proceeds.. go to me! (laughs)

JAKE: That's not true.

AMIR: (to Jake) What- you promised!

JAKE: When?!

AMIR: I'm- Not yet, but I was gonna make ya! (tickles Jake)

JAKE: (pushing Amir away) Heyheyhey, don't touch me. (to the cameraman) Cut. (to Amir) Don't touch me, right?



JAKE: (to the cameraman) Hey, Jon, can I see your frame? (he looks at the presumably turned-around viewscreen.) [Can] You punch in, just a little bit? (The camera zooms in slightly.) Perfect, thank you.

AMIR: So it wasn't perfect.

JAKE: It wasn't; he adjusted it; and now it is.

AMIR: AKA, he's bad at his job!

JAKE: He's good at his job. Please just relax.

AMIR: I will relax, but.. somebody's getting spanked!



JAKE: (to the camera) Most of all, we're excited for you guys, our fans, to see it. We really think you're gonna love it.

AMIR: Yeah, and yet every single one of you hates it. How do you think that makes us feel?--

JAKE: (to Amir) Why are you saying people hate it?

AMIR: Cuz,- I'm insecure.

JAKE: Right, I know.

AMIR: Hhhh. So you just agree with me, right? Is that what everybody's saying behind my back, that I'm insecure?



AMIR: (to the cameraman) Hey boy, what's your social security number, huh? Because I wanna know why you can't get the frame right!

JAKE: (to Amir) Don't call him boy, alright? Let's just get started.

AMIR: I wanna get started, but I wanna know why homeboy over here can't do his job!

JAKE: He is doing his job! You're not doing your job!

AMIR: No, my job is to bring the ruckus.

JAKE: No, your job is to promote the special.

AMIR: No, your job is to promote the special, ok; my job is to bring the ruckus!

JAKE: Stop saying ruckus--

AMIR: Ruckus, yeah.



AMIR: (to the cameraman) Boy? Last four digits of your soc' (pronounced sOHsh), right now; I'm gonna st- I'm gonna jack your I.D.!



JAKE: (to the camera) It was a real group effort, and we're really proud of everybody that helped make it happen.

AMIR: (sarcastically, with air quotes) Yeah, group effort. (laughs)

JAKE: ...It was.

AMIR: (sarcastically) Yeah, ok--



AMIR: (to the cameraman) Hey boy? Can you zoom in on this? (holds up a middle finger) Or zoom in on this, huh! (lifting his pelvis up off the couch and holding his extended middle finger up next to it) You're holding up the process!

JAKE: (to Amir) YOU are holding up the process.--
