(Amir walks over and sits in seat)

JAKE: Wow.

AMIR: What? It's like 4:30.

JAKE: No, that's not it, you're always like seven hours late.

AMIR: Consistent.

JAKE: I'm surprised you're not fired.

AMIR: Why would I be fired?

JAKE: Do you not remember yesterday?



FLASHBACK

RICKY: (to Jake) Hey, buddy. Only 100 likes on your last article, you're slipping there.

(Jake chuckles)

AMIR: (laughing and standing up) What's that?

JAKE: Hey, Amir, come on.

AMIR: (to Jake) Hey, butt the fuck out of this. (to Ricky) What did you say to my man over here?

RICKY: We were, uh, talking about his last article. Did you read it? It's pretty good.

AMIR: Yeah, I read all of his articles.

JAKE: Alright just sit down, please.

AMIR: (to Jake) One... second. (to Ricky) When was the last time you wrote anything for CollegeHumor, man?

RICKY: Amir!

AMIR: Do you even write anymore?

RICKY: Amir, just chill out.

AMIR: Chill out. (laughs) Chill out he tells me. (slaps Ricky)

JAKE: Jesu-



AMIR: We discussed the matter in his office and resolved the issue like two mature... adults.

(Jake chuckles)



FLASHBACK

AMIR: (sobbing, on his knees, in Ricky's office) Just one more chance, I'm begging your, you can't fire me! (Amir continues sobbing)

RICKY: (while Amir is sobbing) Amir. Amir, get up. Get up, you're embarrassing yourself. Amir, I have glass walls, people can see exactly what's happening in here.

(camera pans to reveal people watching)

AMIR: (still sobbing) I don't care!

RICKY: Get up!

AMIR: (still sobbing) One more chance, (simultaneously) please, I beg you.

RICKY: (simultaneously) One more chance, sure, just get up.

AMIR: (still sobbing) Two. Two more chances, (simultaneously) and then I'm done, I swear.

RICKY: (simultaneously) Whatever, two chances, just get up! Just get up!

(Amir stands)

RICKY: Are we cool? (Amir slaps him) Ahh!

AMIR: You're a fucking pushover, you know that?
