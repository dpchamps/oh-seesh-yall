NARRATOR: Previously, on Jake and Amir:

BEN: Some party pooper took a dump inside the copier, and I'm tryin' to find out who it was... [cut] No more cool laid-back dude! It's all fuckin' over now!



INTRO

JAKE: I'm Jake...

AMIR: I'm Amir...

BEN: [shrill Italian accent] It's-a me, Ben!

AMIR: Oh no, it's too loud. / JAKE: No, that's offensive!



[Ben now has a new outfit, a baseball bat, and a goatee. No time has elapsed since the end of the last episode.]

BEN: You think this is fuckin' funny?

JAKE: You grew a goatee?

BEN: Shut the fuck up, okay? Did you... [points at Amir] take a shit in the copier?

[There is a long pause.]

AMIR: Yeah, no.

BEN: ...Which one?

AMIR: Ya know?

BEN: Ya know...?

AMIR: Ya know it's no.

BEN: Ya know it's no!

JAKE: Sounds a little suspicious, right? He started to say yeah.

BEN/AMIR: [talking over Jake] Ya know it's no. [high-five] Ya know it's no.

JAKE: How--

BEN: Jake... did you take a shit in the copier?

JAKE: No.

[Ben punches Jake in the head.]

JAKE: Ow! ...Fuck, dude!

BEN: I'm gonna ask you one more time, and this time, I'm not gonna be so nice.

JAKE: That wasn't nice. You just hit me! I didn't shit in th--

BEN: Jake... did you take a shit in the copier?

JAKE: No.

[Ben begins punching Jake in the head again.]

JAKE: [punch] Ow, can you-- [punch] Ow! Hey!

BEN: Hold his arms.

[Amir complies, and holds Jake's arms behind the chair.]

JAKE: Nonono don't-- [punch] Ow! Ow-- 

[Ben leans into Jake's crotch.]

JAKE: What the hell is--

[Ben unzips Jake's pants and starts blowing him.]

JAKE: Stop-- ...Ohh...

BEN: Gggg-gggg-gggg...

[Jake pushes Ben out of his lap.]

JAKE: Get off of me! What the fuck was that? He just gave me head. [punch] Ow!

BEN: You gonna tell me what I need to know?

JAKE: No! You just beat me up and sucked my dick.

BEN: I've got a family waiting for me at home; I don't need to be doing this bullshit.

JAKE: Well, go back to your family!

BEN: It's not my family. It's a family I kidnapped.

JAKE: Oh, my God...

BEN: What do you mean, Oh my God?

JAKE: What are their names?

BEN: They're normal names. I didn't name 'em. Paul, Janet, Stanson...

JAKE: Stanson's not that normal.

BEN: I named the last one. [points at Amir] Where were you yesterday at noon, Amir-- and if you bullshit me, man--

AMIR: I was by the copier.

BEN: This copier?

AMIR: Yeah.

BEN: That doesn't mean anything, you know--

JAKE: It d-- it means a lot--

BEN: Stop. Keep going, Amir.

AMIR: I had just gotten back from lunch. Some hole-in-the-wall Mexican place.

BEN: Wha-- where, which ho-- which place?

AMIR: Oh, not a r-- not a place, this actual hole in the wall that I found a burrito in. Then I went to Taco Bell and got one of the T-- the d-Dorito Taco-Lacos.

JAKE: I don't think that's what it's called. [punch] Ow, stop it!

BEN: Hold his arms, Amir.

JAKE: No, don't!

[Ben leans into Jake's crotch again, using his hands as well this time.]

BEN: Flick-flick-flick, flick, flick, flick, flick...

JAKE: St-- quit flicking-- ohh... oh, my G-- he's sucking my dick!

[Ben comes back up, and Jake shoves him.]

JAKE: That was illegal, man! That was illegal.

[Ben retorts calmly, but is drowned out each time by Jake.]

JAKE: I didn't want that! I shit in the copier, okay? Stop beating me up. Stop sucking me off. I shit in the copier!

BEN: Well, that's funny... 'cuz that's impossible.

JAKE: Why?

BEN: ...'Cuz I shit in the copier.

[Jake sits in stunned silence. Amir is awestruck.]

JAKE: What the fuck?

[Amir begins clapping for Ben.]

BEN: [mouthing] Thank you. Hey.

JAKE: That's not impressive.

BEN: It was me the whole time!

[Amir continues clapping. Ben does a little victory dance, and then winds up and gives Jake another punch in the head.]

JAKE: Ow.
