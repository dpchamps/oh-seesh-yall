Episode

(Amir repeatedly waves at Jake)

Jake: I already acknowledged you.

Amir: Evenin'.

Jake: Morning.

Amir: Bad to see you.

Jake: You too.

Amir: No, shut up. Er... Keep talking.

Jake: What are you doing?

Amir: Today is not Opposite Day. Or it's not not...

Jake: Oh my god. Are you kidding me? Are you serious right now? You're an adult! You're a grown-up and a you're doing this.

Amir: Thank you! Er, you're wel—sor—you're welc—no—sorry!

Jake: This is some really elementary school level shit, buddy.

Amir: Yeah that means it's high school level shit, not buddy.

Jake: Still be pretty immature then, right? Since you're almost 30?

Amir: I don't not appreciate, or the opposite of appreciate that so—

Jake: Your nose is bleeding.

Amir: Oh, dammit. Er, fine, good. Frig it! I'm overthinking it!

Jake: Okay, well you know what, if thinking of opposites makes your nose bleed, I'd advise you not to partake in Opposite Day.

Amir: No! Er, yes!

Jake: Or at least go back to school. Try to make yourself smart.

Amir: Okay, you know what? For the rest of the day, I'm not going to ignore you.

Jake: Fine. I'm just gonna leave you with one final thought: I have a vagina, you have a penis.

Amir: No, today we are both having a vagina.

Jake: Nah, sorry man. Today, I have a tiny little vagina, and you have a big ol' penis.

Amir: I have a pussy! I have a tight little pussy! (Jake films Amir) And, I'm a nerd! And, we're not friends!

Jake: Great, I got that all on camera.

Amir: Delete that video you fucking dickwad.

Jake: So it's not Opposite Day anymore.

Amir: Opposite Day just took a big old timeout when I became concerned about what you're gonna be doing with that footage of me saying 
some pretty compromising shit! Namely, that I have a pussy, that I'm a nerd, and that we aren't friends!

Jake: That was everything you said.

Amir: No. Yes. What?

Jake: Right. So definitely I am posting that video online. That's why I took it.

Amir: At least say that it's Opposite Day—

Jake: No.

Amir: —in the caption!

Jake: No!

Amir: Good. Fine. Everybody please listen up. Despite what video on the internet you may or may not have seen yet, I am not a nerd and 
I do have a pussy.

Jake: Wow.

Amir: Don't have a pussy. Keep taping. Keep taping! I don't have a pussy!

Jake: I'm not taping anything.

Amir: You know what, here. Here it is. (Stands on the desk and pulls down his shorts) My glorious hog in all of its glory. That's 
right. Does this look like a tight small pussy to you? I don't frikking think so!

(Paul comes in)

Paul: Amir! Amir Amir Amir. What are you doing?! This is work! You're fired.

Amir: Yeah, well, the joke's on you, sir, because today is Opposite Day, so you just told me I'm hired.

Paul: Dammit he's right! Carry on gentleman.

Jake: Are you kidding me?!
