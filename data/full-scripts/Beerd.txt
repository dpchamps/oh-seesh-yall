Jake: Hey, Amir. What are you doing? 
Amir: I'm growing a beerd. 
Jake: What's a beerd? 
Amir: Well, you know what a beard is right? 
Jake: Yeah. 
Amir: So a beerd is like a beard, but made out of beer (holds up beer can). 
Jake: Oh...
Amir: It's...beerd (motions with hands). 
Jake: Kind of like a spork is a spoon and a fork? 
Amir: Exactly. 
Jake: Now I get it. 
(Amir opens beer and proceeds to pour it on his chin)
Jake: You shouldn't do this. 
Amir: It's, honestly, I'm like half-way done. It's almost over, practically.
Jake: The joke--the joke is in the spelling of beerd. 
Amir: It's--look at me! It's too late! It doesn't matter if it's the spelling, it's too late. 
Jake: It's then--it's not gonna work. 
Amir: It is gonna work, just stop--
Jake: Let's do quick characters. 
(another person enters bathroom. all laugh) 
Amir: Jason, you weren't supposed to see this. Get out! 
Jason: (backs out of bathroom) Send me a fax when I can pee.
Amir: Or--or anything. I'll send you an email or a fax. Let's do that again.
