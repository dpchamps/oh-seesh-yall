INTRO

JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.

AMIR: Not me! My eyes are closed.

JAKE: Perfect. [sound of a metal impact, like a pot]

AMIR: Ow!



[Jake is using the copier. Amir shows up.]

AMIR: [pulling down his pants] Check it out.

JAKE: Can you please just go back to your desk? I'm trying to work--

[Amir hoists himself up to sit on the glass, which immediately shatters under his weight.]

AMIR: Ohh!

JAKE: Oh!

AMIR: Oh, it's in me!

JAKE: Oh, God!

AMIR: Oh, shards!

JAKE: Shards?

AMIR: Shards where I shart!

JAKE: I'll get help.

AMIR: [grabbing Jake] No! No, it's funny!

JAKE: ...What?

AMIR: It's a funny goof!

JAKE: Dude, you are clearly in a lot of pain right now.

AMIR: It's gonna be worth it! When it starts copying my ass!

JAKE: You're not gonna have an ass when this is all done! You just sliced it, buddy! You sliced it wide open!

[Amir hits a button on the copier. It begins scanning, and Amir screams.]

JAKE: Oh!

AMIR: It's burning my anus!

JAKE: Then get off it!

[Jake tries to pull Amir. Amir pushes him away.]

AMIR: No!

JAKE: Hey!

AMIR: You'll ruin the joke!

JAKE: Amir, your ass is burned.

AMIR: Yeah, it's burned. It's burned bad.

JAKE: It's cut!

AMIR: Absolutely! Sliced from taint to sphincter! Gutted like a fish!

JAKE: So climb up on out of that copier, huh? Pal? Can't be worth it.

AMIR: ...Is it funny?

JAKE: Is what funny?

AMIR: The copies. Am I the office clown as of yet, do you think?

JAKE: Nothing's funny about this! It's self-mutilation, bud! And there are no copies.

AMIR: Where's the paper?

JAKE: You pressed "fax"! You're faxing a picture of your burned, bleeding asshole to my accountant.

AMIR: Then have him scan and email it back!

JAKE: It's a her, and no.

AMIR: [chuckling] Chicks can't do math, dude.

JAKE: Don't be misogynistic. You're getting fucked by a copier.

AMIR: It's a five-in-one workstation! And fine, I'll-- I'll copy it. Here we go. Ready?

[Amir presses some buttons, but the copying doesn't begin.]

AMIR: What the butt is that? "PC Load Letter"?

JAKE: The drawer is empty.

AMIR: Will you insert paper to Tray 2?

JAKE: You should have looked before you--

AMIR: Will you insert paper to Tray 2?

JAKE: No! I will not! I will not do that. I'm not gonna help you.

AMIR: Fine. I'll do it without you.

[Amir begins bending forward slowly, moaning in pain.]

JAKE: I'll do it. God, just stop.

AMIR: This-- this may kill me, sure, but, like with any tortured artist, my work will live beyond me.

[Jake kneels down, surrounded by shards of bloodied glass, and loads the paper tray.]

AMIR: I shall be remembered as a martyr, a cool, and a philosopher. For I have the anus of a god.



[Amir has posted a copy on the bulletin board. He watches it intently to see if anybody will react. Pat walks by, looks at it, smirks, and continues on his way.]

AMIR: Perfect.

JAKE: Nobody even knows you did that. And you have to wear a diaper now.

[Amir, wearing a diaper, puts his leg up on the desk to strike a pose. There is a loud ripping sound.]

AMIR: Worth it, baby!

JAKE: Oh God, you need new stitches.

AMIR: Yes.
