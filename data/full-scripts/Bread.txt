INTRO
JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
AMIR: Who wants free comedy?
JAKE: Ass.
AMIR: [laughing] Alright.
[Jake is at his desk. Amir comes in with a paper package and an umbrella.]
JAKE: It's not raining outside.
AMIR: Hey, check this out. I, uh... made my own bread last night?
JAKE: Are you asking me a question?
AMIR: [suddenly out of breath] Yeah, I just figured, uh, why not? [unwrapping and holding up a loaf of bread] I've been, uh, interested in that... kind of thing for a while now, so... ta-dah!
JAKE: Wow... okay. [gives a thumbs-up] Nice, bud.
AMIR: [still out of breath] Yeah, last night for dinner, I was, uh, jonesing for, like, a grilled cheese sandwich, you know. So I open the door and I just see, like, uh, cheddar?
JAKE: Just make them sentences instead of questions. Statements, okay? [Amir nods] You're telling me a story; you're not asking me.
AMIR: And I had, um... [pause] tomatoes?
JAKE: ...Did you have it or not? I don't know.
AMIR: I had tomatoes?
JAKE: Okay?
AMIR: But hey! No bread, so I, uh... [long pause] I open the fridge, and I'm like "You know what, Jake"--
JAKE: --"Amir"--
AMIR: --"Jake, today's the day... today's the day you finally... you figure it out. You figure it out, and you get it done." So, uh... let me cut you off a slice, huh? [grabbing a knife]
JAKE: You know what? I-- you know, I appreciate the offer. I actually am just not that hungry.
AMIR: [sawing the bread loaf] Come on, please? It'll mean a lot to me if you... try a slice!
JAKE: No, I know it would mean a lot to you. That's one of the reasons I don't want to try the bread.
AMIR: [still sawing] I'm curious to see what you think about it.
JAKE: I wish you were less curious.
AMIR: [holding the bread off the table, still sawing] Whether you like it or not is actually what I'm most curious about!
JAKE: Right, of course. I know.
[Amir finishes cutting a slice of bread. He hands it to Jake.]
AMIR: Here you go. Careful, it is hard.
[Amir drops the bread, and it makes a clanking sound. Jake picks it up.]
JAKE: ...Why?
AMIR: Sometimes bread comes out like that.
[Jake tries to bite into the bread, and fails.]
JAKE: Ow! Really hard.
AMIR: Well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.
JAKE: This is chalk!
AMIR: That is uncalled for! It is chalky, to be sure, but there are some redeeming characteristics.
JAKE: No, like this bread is legitimately chalk! I mean-- [pulls out a chalkboard, draws on it using the bread] --look!
AMIR: Enough! More than enough, actually, okay? There's constructive criticism, and then there's this-- this-- this-- this-- this poison that you say to me...
JAKE: This bread is poison!
AMIR: Do you like it... or not?
JAKE: Like it? I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!
AMIR: Appreciated!
JAKE: Never a compliment.
AMIR: Alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam! [Handing Jake a plastic container with a live rabbit sitting in it] Yeah! Just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread. [laughing] Now you have me saying "chalk", ya dingbat!
JAKE: How?
AMIR: No-- I don't know how! You said "chalk", and then suddenly I'm saying "chalk" instead of "bread". It's a whole thing.
JAKE: No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?
AMIR: It is jam! You just press its head against the bread-- not chalk mind you-- [laughs] and then you use a knife to sort of squeeze its little jam insides out of its anus onto the cha-- [pause] bread, oh my God, I hate you!
[Jake stares, dumbfounded, at Amir.]
AMIR: Here! Here! Give me that-- give me that rabbit jam. I'll show you.
JAKE: No! I will not!
AMIR: Excuse you.
JAKE: Excuse you!
AMIR: No, excuse you!
JAKE: Absolutely excuse you!
AMIR: Give me the rabbit back, my friend.
[Jake gets up and leaves with the rabbit.]
AMIR: Hey-- hey! Get-- that guy's getting away with my jam! Get back here, you thief!
[Amir picks up the remaining loaf and throws it at Jake. He misses and hits Rosie in the head.]
ROSIE: Ahh!
AMIR: Oh!
DAVE: [kneeling by Rosie's corpse] He's dead...
