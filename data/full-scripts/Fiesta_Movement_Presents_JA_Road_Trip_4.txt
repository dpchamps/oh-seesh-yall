(Amir and Jake are sitting quietly in the car)

AMIR: This is nice. Isn't it? 

JAKE: Yeah. 

AMIR: What's your favorite part? 

JAKE: It's look- Just, can we just enjoy the view? 

AMIR: What's that? 

JAKE: We don't have to talk. Just-just enjoy the view and then we get back on the road, OK? We have a long night of driving.

AMIR: OK. Let's enjoy the view. 

JAKE: Just enjoy the view. No talking. 

AMIR: No talking, just enjoying. 

JAKE: Just silence. 

AMIR: (pause) Silence is golden. (pause) It's the primo. It's the top--

JAKE: Shhhh. 

AMIR: Shhh.

JAKE: Shh. 

AMIR: Shhhhwhewww.

JAKE: (softly) Come on. 

AMIR: (softly) Sorry. Shh.

AMIR: My neck hurts when I go like that. Can you hear that?

JAKE: Just please be quiet.

AMIR: Can you hear that?

JAKE: Shh!

AMIR: It's like uh, it's a thing. (a bit loudly) Starting now, please silence all cell phones. (chuckles) Shhhhhh. (pause) (loudly imitates a race car) No talking or noises right? (begins tapping on a coke can) Sin gas, please. Sans gas, s'il vous pla√Æt.  (opens the can and takes a sip) Ah. (coughs) How do they put--(spills soda on Jake)

JAKE: OH! 

AMIR: Oh my lo-I was going to wear that tomorrow!

JAKE: We are here. We're at this-We're standing at this guy. 



AMIR:  Come on! Come on!

AMIR: We're in a fight! I'm sorry!
