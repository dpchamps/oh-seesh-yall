[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir is listening to his headphones, bouncing his head to the music, playing air guitar, and making a silly face. Jake is ignoring him.]

(Amir starts chatting with Jake on AIM.)

AMIR: lol.

(Jake winces.)

AMIR: Roflmao.

AMIR: I probably look like such a drok.

AMIR: *dork*

(Jake starts responding to Amir in the chat.)

JAKE: i'm not looking at you so. its fine.

AMIR: i'm rocking out that's all

JAKE: k

AMIR: Pretty hard though.

AMIR: Pick your head up if you're interested.

AMIR: are you?

JAKE: im not.

AMIR: Whenever I'm having a bad day, or feeling down about something, I know that feeling is always fleeting because soon i'll be back at my desk, sitting across from my best friend, and just -- everything is perfect again. You fix everything by just being here.

AMIR: LOL

JAKE: god

JAKE: please tell me that's a song lyric

AMIR: it is

JAKE: good

AMIR: but it's a song I recorded about you.

(Jake recoils in annoyance and exasperation. Amir continues staring blankly at Jake.)

JAKE: im gonna block you

JAKE: sorry

JAKE: lata

AMIR: WAIT! I was gonna ask you if you had any vending machine tokens. ME WANT A SNACK!

AMIR: ME HAVENT EATEN IN DAYS ROFLMAO

JAKE: vending machine tokens...

JAKE: you mean coins?

AMIR: All's I know is that I need 75 vending machine dollars to git a kit kat.

JAKE: you can use coins to buy anything you know. theyre not vending machine specific.

(Amir laughs at the apparent ridiculousness of Jake's claim.)

AMIR: Yeah, okay. So I can walk into a mcdonalds, put these metal disks into the guy at the counter, and he'll spit mcnuggets into my mouth I guess?!

JAKE: gross

AMIR: 1,000

(Amir laughs and bobs his head to the music.)
