Jake: What the hell is wrong with you? [Jake pushes Amir]

Jake: What the hell is wrong with you!?

Amir: Sorry, I feel like a dick.

Jake: w-will you at least get me a towel? I'm getting light headed.

Amir: Follow my voice

[Amir is holding a small piece of a tissue.]

Jake: Don't make me follow your voice, just put it in my hand... You're kidding me!

[Jake wipes the blood from under his nose]

Jake: Oh my god.

Amir: It's all over your shirt bro.

Jake I- just get away from me.

Amir: Listen I feel really bad, you hit me. 

[Amir puts his hand out, Jake slaps it away.]

Amir: OW!

Jake: Don't try to...

Amir: Look it's all re- we're even.
