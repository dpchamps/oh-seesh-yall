Jake: Jesus, I have 98 emails from facebook.

Amir: Really? That's weird

Jake: Did you send me 98 facebook gifts?

Amir: 99 brother

Jake: Oh my god, these are a dollar each. You know that?

Amir: Yeeeesss

Jake: How do you have that kind of money?

Amir: dad's cc [laughs]

Jake: And he's okay with you doing this?

Amir: He thinks they are for a gift for my girlfriend

Jake: You don't have a girlfriend

Amir: According to Jim I do

Jake: Do you think that's a pun? God man, this is ridiculous

[Amir dives under desk]

Jake: I just don't understand. What are you doing? Let go of my foot.  

[Amir re-emerges with Jake's shoe in his hand]

Jake: Amir what are you doing?

Amir: Er, what size are you?

Jake: I'll tell you what size I am, just stop

[Amir places the shoe over his nose and mouth and inhales]

Jake: Stop it. Stop it right now. Stop it.

[Amir kisses shoe, Jake gets out of his chair and goes over to him]

Jake: Give it back now. Right now. Right the fuck now.

[Jake tackles Amir off his chair onto the floor]
