(Jake and Amir both standing up, breathing heavily and looking happy)

AMIR: We did it!

JAKE: Hell yeah we did!

(They jump simultaneously, high five in the air, the frame freezes and Nataie Imbruglia's song Torn starts playing. The frame unfreezes and they both get back on the ground.)

JAKE: What was that?

AMIR: Torn. Just this, it's like about a guy who just walks around beating people up. And he like, stabs people in the neck and then just plays with blood. And beats the shit outta people for fun. Hwoh, hwoh. (mimicks punching Jake) I figure for high five, we just come down, and it's like Nothing's right. We're torn.

JAKE: A girl wrote it. And a girl sings it. It's about a girl who got broken up with by a guy.

AMIR: I put it on my workout mix cause it's like so, it's just core. Just... (inhales and flexes pecs)

JAKE: You don't go to the gym.

AMIR: No, but... Come, on let's do just one more high five, we'll choose like the manliest song, (JAKE: No, I'm not doing it) it'll be about like the Terminator or something, just like, killing people, one more time! Up high! Super sick! Let's do this!

(Amir jumps with his hand raised for a high five, but Jake doesn't jump with him. He slaps Jake in the arm with his high five hand.)

AMIR: Come on, man!

JAKE: Come on!

(Amir slaps Jake on the face. Frame freezes mid-slap and Torn starts playing again)

As a side note, this is one of the episodes in which Amir wears the SILF t-shirt.
