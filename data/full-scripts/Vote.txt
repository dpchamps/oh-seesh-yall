Jake and Amir are sitting on a couch in Jake's apartment.



JAKE: Okay, today is the most important day of our lives.

AMIR: FUCKING VOTE ALREADY!!!

JAKE: Don't... swear, but that's the correct message. Everybody needs to vote.

AMIR: I don't care if you're white or black, if you're 9 or 90, just go-

JAKE: Well you can't... you can't be 9.

AMIR: You can be 9, I was 9. Still not convinced?! Call Jake at (917)-446...

JAKE: No, don't... what are you, what are you doing?

AMIR: ...9701. And then that's it.

JAKE: You can't give my phone number out. You know, don't tell me 
your vote doesn't count because you live in California or Texas...

AMIR: Or France or Iraq, just please go out-

JAKE: It might not... it might not count if you live those places because you have to be an American citizen.

AMIR: This isn't an American election. This is a global election. Everybody-

JAKE: It sounds... it sounds smart but I know it's not because you don't mean it as a metaphor. Today is the day, this is it-

AMIR: Whoever gets the most votes wins. Straight up. (Jake shakes his head) It's that simple. Who you voting for Jakey?

JAKE: Well, it's personal I'm not gonna-

AMIR: I'm gonna tickle it out of you! (tickling Jake)

JAKE: Don't touch me!! 

Silence.

AMIR: Fine. V-O-T. Vote!

JAKE: E. 

AMIR: E. Votey. 'sup votey? It's your birthday.

JAKE: V-O-T-E vote. Everybody has a voice.

AMIR: Can't speak, can't vote. Straight up. 

JAKE: That's... not what I meant so...

AMIR: You only get one vote in your whole life. One! Make it count!

JAKE: That's not even close to being true. Why are you still watching this video?! Go vote!

AMIR: Vote for president! Vote for American Idol! We don't care, just vote! Anything!

JAKE: No, well... vote for... vote for president though.

AMIR: Okay, you want four more years of Taylor Hicks?

Black screen.

JAKE: Hey look, promise me you'll take the number out. 

AMIR: Yeah for sure. Nobody, hey listen to me, nobody will know your phone number. 

917-446-9701 Call Now! flashes repeatedly.

JAKE: Okay, thanks. 

Jake slaps Amir on the leg, Amir is obviously in pain but makes no sound.

JAKE: Get out of my apartment now.
