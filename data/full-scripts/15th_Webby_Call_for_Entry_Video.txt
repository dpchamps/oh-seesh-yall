AMIR: And I'm Amir. Sorry. Sorry. 

JAKE: That's fine. It's- You've done that nineteen times. 

AMIR: Yes, and I've apologized all nineteen, so. 



JAKE: Hey, I'm Jake and th--

AMIR: And I'm Am--Wow, I am-- You have a right to be mad at me. 



JAKE: Hi, I'm Jake, and this Amir. And it is that time of the year again. 

AMIR: Oh, you got your period, boy? 

JAKE: Not how those work. It's time to submit to the Webbys. 

AMIR: Oh, I don't know why, the Webby's were last year, and (reaches off screen for the award) oh, we won!

JAKE: Yes, last year's Webbys were last year. 

AMIR: What?



JAKE: Hey, I'm Jake and this is Amir--

AMIR: Wait, sorry. Question. What's my move when you say 'this is amir' and I like uh--

JAKE: Wrong direction. Much, much worse? 



JAKE: The Webbys are looking for new submissions in dozens of categories.

AMIR: Winning! (winks at the camera) . . . Winking. 



JAKE: Why don't we just take a five minute bathroom break or something. We'll collect our thoughts, we'll come back and we'll do it again, OK? 

AMIR: I like it. Which bathroom? 

JAKE: There's only one bathroom.

(Jake is by himself on the couch)

JAKE: Hey, I'm Jake from Jake and Amir, reminding you to get your Webbys submissions in. More info after this video. 

(Amir enters but is off camera)

AMIR: OK, who are you talking to?

JAKE: Nobody. 

AMIR: You better not be doing this Webby thing without me!

JAKE: I'm not, relax.

(Amir walks right in front of camera to fiddle with it)

AMIR: All right, then let's play it back and we'll see!  

JAKE: Don't touch the camera, you don't know what you're doing!

AMIR: Let go! Let me use my key!
