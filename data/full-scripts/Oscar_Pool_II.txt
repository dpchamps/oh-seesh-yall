INTRO

AMIR:  Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.

JAKE: Cool, good job.

AMIR: I know it kills you to see me doing so well.



AMIR: Oh, by the dubs, who won the Oscar pool?

JAKE: You mean the one that I organized, that I set up? (in a weird voice) Uh-oh, spaghetti sauce. (normal voice) I did.

AMIR: Hehehe, why uh-oh?

JAKE: Oh, cuz everybody's gonna be all like oh wait, you collected all the money. Um. What's that about?, you know?  Haters gonna hate, players gonna play.

AMIR: Hehe...you just, you said you were gonna send out an email with how everyone did, and you never did. So..

JAKE: (singing) Go on, take the money and run. 

AMIR: Hahahahaha.

JAKE: (singing) Go on, take the money -  (talking) I forgot to send out the email. I did. But trust me, there's no trickery afoot. (in a weird voice, and with hand gestures like a president) I did not make sexual steals with that Oscars. That's a campaign promise.

AMIR: I never said you stole or cheated or any-

JAKE: Good, cuz I didn't. And i have the text to prove it.

AMIR: Okay.  Not that you cheated, what text though?

JAKE: My sister texted me congratulations AFTER she found out that I won the Oscar pool.  That's how you know my picks were locked in. Otherwise, why would she be proud of me?

AMIR: What??

JAKE: What? A but? In your butt? Oh my goodness. Ah. Ah. Ah.

AMIR: Hahaha. Let me see the text.

JAKE: Here's a question, I won enough money last night to legit hire a hit man to kill you.  Is that scary?

AMIR: I guess so, I mean, is that even true? You won like 200 dollars.

JAKE: Yeah, but I won second place too.

AMIR: How- You said everyone could only submit one, right?

JAKE: Yeah, and you said you weren't gonna be a little bitch today. But looks like everyone's breaking their promises left and right.  Okay, you owe me another 20 bucks, by the way.

AMIR: Why?

JAKE: Losing fee!

AMIR: I already paid you 20 dollars to enter.

JAKE: Yeah, to enter!  That's the entrance fee! You owe me a losing fee!

(Amir starts to cry)

JAKE: Don't cry. You're gonna owe me a 50 dollar bitch fee if you cry.

AMIR: (through tears) I can't afford the bitch fee.

JAKE: You be - ohmygod, you're being such a bitch.

STREETER: Ooh, guys, what's uh, what's going on?

JAKE: Amir's crying cuz I futt-bucked [sic] him at the Oscar pool.

AMIR: No.

STREETER: Oh yeah! The Oscar pool!  You never sent that email, man. How'd I do?

JAKE: On a scale of one to third?  

STREETER: Yeah.

JAKE: You didn't. Okay? Sorry.

STREETER: Oh. okay. Well, how'd you do, then?

JAKE: Oh, I uh...uh...uh...uh...CAME, in first, second AND turd. As in, you guys need to learn how to be funny.

AMIR: Ok, I'm trying!

STREETER: K, I want my money back, Jake.

JAKE: Ok, sorry bro, I actually already spent it on these boots.

AMIR: Those are actually pretty tight.

JAKE: (bowing) Namaste.

STREETER: Okay, you bought those boots ten days ago, man.  The day AFTER you collected my money for the Oscar picks.

JAKE: (singing and bouncing up and down) These boots are made for f**king.  (Amir starts bouncing up and down in a similar manner) That's just what they'll do.  One of these days these boots are gonna skeet [sic] all over you, oh!

STREETER: Nobody likes you guys.

JAKE AND AMIR: We know!
