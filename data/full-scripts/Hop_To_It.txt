Jake: Hey guys!

?: Hey Jake.

Sarah: Hi!

Jake: What are you doing?

?: We're gonna get dinner, wanna come?

Jake: Yes, but I don't have any cash.

Sarah: Oh, that's ok. We can stop by an ATM or something.

Jake: That's really far away, actually. I have an idea. Dinner's gonna be on me, hold on.

Sarah: Nice.

(Jake bunny hops over to Amir)

Jake: What's up, dude?

Amir: Counting DVDs, yes sir. 

Jake: What number were you at?

Amir: Whatever three after nine is. What was that?

Jake: Don't bother. It's my move. Can't use it. 

Amir: I'm interested. In. Buying it.

Jake: (rubbing ear) Whispering is when you talk lower near my ear, ok? Anyway, it's not for sale, sorry.

Amir: Everything is for sale, brotha. What say you to twenty?

Jake: Don't make me laugh. See you tommorow. (starts leaving)

Amir: Wait wait wait wait wait! Forty. 

Jake: Sixty.

Amir: Eighty.

Jake: Done for eighty.

Amir: I only have five twenties. 

Jake: Cool. I'll do it for a hundred. No refunds. 

Amir: I stopped listening to you after you said I had a nice hairdo.

Jake: Then you never started listening. 

Amir: (hops away, trips on chair)

Amir: (hops toward a group playing Rock Band)

Guy: What the fuck are you doing?

Amir: (laughs) I know, it's so stupid. I was making fun of some homo who I saw on the subway. Quick question. Does anyone have a hundred bucks I can borrow? 

Guy 2: Why don't you hope to an ATM and get it?

Amir: (laughs) Yeah, right. I'll see y'all later. (running away) Jake!

*I have no idea what the name of Guy, Guy 2, or ? are. Any help?
