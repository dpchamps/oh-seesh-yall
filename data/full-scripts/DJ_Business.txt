INTRO

AMIR: [with his mouth full] Hey, you're watching Jake and--

JAKE: You're watching Jake and Amir.

AMIR: [still with his mouth full] Let me do it!



[Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is messily eating a meatball sandwich.]

AMIR: [enjoying his sandwich] Ohhh, yeah! [laughs with pleasure] Oh! Did I tell you I'm doing a gluten-free June? Nothing too drastic. Just like a... gastric bypass, maybe a tummy-tuck, and a... a face lift.

JAKE: "Nothing too drastic"? You're talking about... surgery! Invasive, elective surgery!

AMIR: Chill with that shit.

[Amir's sandwich begins falling apart onto his desk.]

JAKE: Meatballs on your keyboard.

AMIR: Ahhh, crap!

[Amir's phone rings.]

AMIR: Ahhh, double crap!

JAKE: Try to do things quietly.

[Amir spits his mouthful of food into his shirt pocket. Jake reacts with disgust. Amir picks up the phone.]

AMIR: [doing a charismatic DJ voice into the phone] Yo yo yo, DJ Shmumu on the house! In the line, and turnin' it up! How's down, my playa?

JAKE: Dude. So bad.

AMIR: Sounds awesome! Let me just check with my secretary! [to Jake] Hey, do we have work on Wednesday the 25th?

JAKE: I'm not your secretary-- and... come on, of course. We have work every Wednesday--

AMIR: Can do! Pencil this DJ...! Up? [hangs up]

JAKE: Not smart. Just gonna confuse him.

AMIR: You'll never in a million years guess what I've been doing lately.

JAKE: Starting a DJ business.

AMIR: Better. Starting a DJ business.

JAKE: That's what I guessed. Why have a conversation with you if you're just gonna--

AMIR: [shaking with excitement] Good question! Business is booming!

JAKE: Can you please not shake so much? Just contain the excitement. You enter every single conversation with an agenda, so, like, no matter what direction it goes--

AMIR: Business is booming. I'm happy; you're happy for me! [laughs] I'm doing everything right now pro bono, but that doesn't mean I'm not makin' bank! [rubs his fingers together]

JAKE: Yes it does! If you're using "pro bono" correctly.

AMIR: I can't help it if my Yelp reviews suck!

JAKE: That's one thing you can help! The reviews suck if you suck! So you improve yourself!

AMIR: [mouthing] Wow.

JAKE: I'm looking at them right now. "DJ Shmumu pressed 'play' on a Spotify playlist and fainted."

AMIR: Yeah!

JAKE: "DJ Shmumu fainted upon arrival!"

AMIR: Yeah!

JAKE: "He woke up and tried to load a Spotify playlist, but promptly fainted again!"

AMIR: Yeah!

JAKE: Stop saying "yeah"! You shouldn't be fainting this much.

[Amir briefly faints and regains consciousness.]

AMIR: Whoa, dude!

JAKE: Oh my God.

AMIR: I just blacked out for a spell...

JAKE: You fainted!

AMIR: Ohh!

JAKE: Sleep more. Get a better diet.

AMIR: [eating bits of sandwich out of his pocket] I'm gluten-free!

JAKE: ...On second thought, man, just let yourself die.

AMIR: Ouch much? [chuckles] That hurt more than my last Yelp review!

JAKE: Right, which it looks like you wrote thirty seconds ago, so I guess you wrote it as you were fainting. "DJ Shmumu's pretty good, but he deserves to die. Hold on, I think I'm fainting."

[Amir's phone rings. Amir picks up.]

AMIR: Mickey, my friend!

JAKE: Hang up.

AMIR: Yes, my friend. I too am excited and eager to be DJing your daughter's wedding tonight!

JAKE: Why does he trust you?

AMIR: Yes, I already spoke to her regarding the playlist; it is set in stone. I assure you she is a lovely bride, and she's gonna get the reception she deserves. I'm actually... setting up the turntables as we speak, Mickey!

JAKE: [shaking his head] Why do you do this?

AMIR: Not to give too much away, Mickey, but I figure we start with the Hora, move on to some playful, yet tasteful, Golden Oldies, before transitioning beautifully and seamlessly to the father-daughter dance! I believe the one you requested... [typing on his keyboard, winking to Jake] let me pull it up right now... is, uh... that's right! It's called "I'm not actually DJing your daughter's wedding tonight, Mickey!"

JAKE: Here we go.

AMIR: She's gonna be an ugly bride, Mickey, and she's probably not gonna get married, Mickey!

JAKE: That has nothing to do with being a DJ.

AMIR: You know why, Mickey? Because my Yelp reviews suck, Mickey!

JAKE: How is that his fault?

AMIR: News flash, Mickey: I press play on Spotify... and I faint, Mickey! Yeah! I really faint, Mickey! In fact, Mickey... I'm fainting right now, Mickey... Mickey, help me out, Mickey. [drops the phone]

JAKE: [yelling to be heard over the phone] He fainted, Mickey.

AMIR: Mickey!

JAKE: Mickey, he's gone.

AMIR: Mickey.

JAKE: Hey Mickey, let's hope he dies, huh? For both our sakes, Mickey.

[Amir grunts groggily.]

JAKE: Mickey.
