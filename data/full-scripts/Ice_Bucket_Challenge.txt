INTRO

JAKE: You're watching a really cool episode of Jake and Amir.

AMIR: Nice.

JAKE: I rule in it.

AMIR: I know.



[Jake is wearing a sleeveless shirt and addressing the camera.]

JAKE: Hey, everybody. Jake here. Look, I've been seeing this little thing poppin' up around on Facebook, just... just here and there, but you know me. I like to get into trends early. So here I--

AMIR: [leaning in from off-screen] I did it a few weeks ago!

JAKE: Did I invite you in here to brag, Blumenfeld? I don't like to share the limelight, so why don't you tread light. Fucker.

AMIR: You invited me in here 'cause you said nobody else would hold your bucket for you.

JAKE: [trying to drown out Amir] Shhhhhh. Just relax about why I invited you in here. [to the camera] Look, been seein' this Cup of Water Challenge thing on Facebook, but... you know, I'mma do it J-Witz style, do you two better. First of all: I say fuck it, I'm gonna go a whole bucket. And, uh, another thing, Regis: I put a freakin' ice cube in here. And that is my final answer.

AMIR: Aren't most people doing it with a...with a bucket and--

JAKE: [singing] And IIIIII-ee-III will always ice cube! [Amir cringes] Makes it colder, makes me bolder.

AMIR: It-- it's called the Ice Bucket Challenge--

JAKE: [mocking Amir] "It's c-- It's ca-- It's c--" You got a stuttering prboblem much, dude?

AMIR: "Prboblem"?

JAKE: Yeah, I said "prboblem". I s-- I misspoke. I misspoke, but you stuttered!

AMIR: No, I did not.

JAKE: [doing a Native American impression] Any-- how! I'm gonna freeze myself with this here bucket, like, uh, Jack Nicholson at the end of the Shining. Hey, you think he ever met Steve Urkel? From Family Matters? [doing a Jack Nicholson impression] "Uhh, did I do that?" [looking at Amir for a reaction]

AMIR: ...Maybe, yeah. I--

JAKE: Alright. Fuck you. [to the camera] Okay. I'm not gonna do this before challenging a couple of my close personal friends to, uh, take the Jake challenge, that is, not a cup, but the fuck-it bucket, and, uh, not just one, but a big-ass cube o' ice! [laughs]

AMIR: S-- ...so yes. Just one.

JAKE: Okay. Bradley Cooper, from Limitless. Tarvis Baker, from Blink-182 [pronounced "eighteen-two"]. And, and another guy: Vanilla Bean Ice himself! Stop-- Hammer time! [humming] Dahh-nah-nah-nah... nah-nah, can't touch this.

AMIR: Alright. Here we go. Ready.

JAKE: Hey, hey, hold on, before you do it, [to the camera] as I understand it, I was challenged to donate a hundred dollars to ALS research, unless I dump this, this bucket of water on my head, in which case... ALS research, y'all owe me a hundred bucks.

AMIR: I don't know if it's that-- like, that--

JAKE: Just-- ...I didn't invite you here to do an interview, did I? Let's do this! Come on!

JAKE/AMIR: Three, two one!

[Amir dumps the bucket over Jake's head. Barely a small cup's worth of water comes out.]

JAKE: [screaming] Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho, that was legit! Less than room temp, dude! Look! Major shrinkage.

[Jake shows Amir his penis below-screen, and Amir, who was initially hopping up and down with adrenaline, stops.]

AMIR: Whoa. The water wasn't that cold.

JAKE: I have a tiny dick.



AMIR: [to the camera] To actually help out, go to ALSA.org!

["ALSA.org" appears on screen. Jake gives a thumbs up.]

AMIR: [to Jake] Your penis was really small.

JAKE: I know.
