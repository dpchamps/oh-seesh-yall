Office

AMIR: Whoa, I just realized that if I stare at the back of your computer for 3 hours it looks like 2 elephants masturbating.

SARAH: Hey Jake are you busy?

AMIR: Yes!

JAKE: No, actually.

SARAH: I found this really cool friendship quiz and I thought we could take it.

AMIR: Oh that's super cool why don't I save you ten minutes and let you know that Jake and I are BBF's, so it doesn't even matter what you get on a quiz.

JAKE: Why don't you shut up for ten minutes, and I can tell you that Sarah and I have been best friends since we were little, and she's gonna know everything.

All right, ready?

SARAH: Yeah.

JAKE: What is my favorite movie?

AMIR: Shawshank Redemption.

JAKE: Okay, you're ruining it for Sarah, right?

SARAH: But I knew that, so.

JAKE: Yeah, that's easy.

All right, What's my favorite food?

AMIR: [High pitched voice] Annie's macaroni and cheese. [Normal Voice] Jake, Annie's macaroni and cheese.

JAKE: It's Annie's macaroni and cheese, good job interrupting.

SARAH: I mean I was just gonna say straight cheese, so.

AMIR: Well you were gonna be straight wrong, so.

JAKE: Straight close.

AMIR: Straight close but no straight cigar.

Jake.

JAKE: Here's one, and Amir's gonna shut up.

What's my mom's job?

SARAH: Oh, I know this she's a teacher.

JAKE: Exactly.

AMIR: Incorrect, she was a teacher but two weeks ago she arrived at school completely stoned... So they fired her.

SARAH: Jesus!

JAKE: Fuck, how did you know that!?

AMIR: She called me.

JAKE: Called you?

AMIR: Well she called you but I picked up. You know, my voice sounds a lot like yours when I go like this: [Jake's voice] Hey mom, tell me more about dad.

SARAH: God, that's so creepy.

[Jake sighs]

SARAH: Oh listen, don't freak out just because he knows everything about you it doesn't matter it has to go both ways.

AMIR: Jake knows everything on that list about me...
