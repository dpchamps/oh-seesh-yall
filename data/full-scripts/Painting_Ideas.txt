INTRO

AMIR: Hi, you're watching art.

JAKE: Jake and Amir.

AMIR: In action. Movement. Comedy.



[Jake is sitting on the couch. After a few seconds, he seems to notice the viewer, curiously narrowing his eyes directly at the camera. Amir comes in and sits beside Jake, distracting him.]

AMIR: Hey bub. Mind if I pitch you some painting ideas?

JAKE: What?

AMIR: I'll take that as a no...

JAKE: Great.

AMIR: ...but I don't take no for an answer! Scoot over!

JAKE: You're already sitting.

AMIR: You're taking up the whole couch!



AMIR: Alright, have you ever seen a painting of just, like, a fucking field? Not even of people. Just a landscape.

JAKE: Yes. Of course.

AMIR: [taken aback] Ow, that hurts...

JAKE: You thought you were the first person ever to come up with the idea of painting nature?

AMIR: Never mind, I said.

JAKE: When did you say "never mind"? You just said it for the first time now.

AMIR: [nodding] Yeah.



AMIR: What's the gayest part of painting?

JAKE: Nothing.

AMIR: [waving his hand] That you do it with a brush.

JAKE: Homophobic. Dumb.

AMIR: Which is why I'm using this. [holds up a palette with paint]

JAKE: You have paint. What would you use to get it on the canvas?

AMIR: ...Oh, no!



AMIR: See if you can wrap your fat little Jew cock around this idea: It's a portrait painting of a woman. [pauses] ...Hmm? Thoughts?

JAKE: ...Sure.

AMIR: Has it been done?



AMIR: Alright, what if I forgo the canvas, and just straight up paint on a building?

JAKE: Yeah, that's street art. That's pretty fun. Sure.

AMIR: That's not fun, if it's been done!

JAKE: That's an awful slogan, and a bad way to live your life. It insinuates that nobody but you can have a good idea.

AMIR: Exactly right.

JAKE: Yet all of your ideas so far have been unoriginal.

AMIR: Forget it, I said!

JAKE: No you didn't! You never said what you said you said. I don't think I've ever seen you say what you said you said.



AMIR: You know, what the big issue is is that I was born too late, so all the good shit's already been done.

JAKE: How dare you? You have every modern convenience. I mean, this is probably the only era that you could survive in--

AMIR: I would have killed it in Egypt, as a slave. Did you know, actually, here's a-- ...I came up with the pyramids.



AMIR: What about a dude?

JAKE: Is your goal to paint something totally original?

AMIR: Mm-hmm.

JAKE: That's never been painted before?

AMIR: That's right.

JAKE: And your first three ideas were a dude--

AMIR: [simultaneously] Dude.

JAKE: --a girl--

AMIR: [simultaneously] A girl.

JAKE: --and a landscape.

AMIR: Nature, yeah. Nature landscape.

JAKE: Bad. You're bad.



AMIR: [singing] There will be the sun, let it be...!

JAKE: Great. So to recap, you think you think you came up with the pyramids...

AMIR: Yes.

JAKE: ...and "Let It Be"...

AMIR: [simultaneously] "Let It Be". Correct.

JAKE: ...before-- independently of those things--

AMIR: [simultaneously] Of the Beatles. Yeah, exactly.

JAKE: Got it. Okay, anything else? By the way, you did not hum "Let It Be" right--

AMIR: Cold cuts.

JAKE: Alright...



AMIR: Head of a frog, body of a deer... he's golfing by himself, under the ocean, the floor is fire. Have you seen that?

JAKE: I guess not. No.

AMIR: Perfect!

JAKE: Can you paint it?

AMIR: No, not without an easel.

JAKE: Get out of here. Please. Go.

AMIR: [getting up and walking away] Jesus.

JAKE: Through the window, if you don't mind.

AMIR: [walking back the other way] Are you kidding me?

JAKE: I'm not kidding!



END



[An extended take.]

AMIR: Cold cuts, was me. Sliced turkey, sliced, uh... stuff like that. Have you had a sandwich today?

JAKE: Sliced turkey-- you couldn't come up with another meat?

[Jake and Amir both crack up.]

JAKE: But you invented cold cuts?

AMIR: I don't remember everything I did.
