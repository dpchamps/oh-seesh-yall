INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching a very green episode of Jake and Amir!

JAKE: Nice one.

AMIR: What?



[Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir has a pair of shears, and is trimming a large potted plant.]

JAKE: So you're not even pretending that you do work for the company anymore?

AMIR: Work is fun, but I've actually been pretty into hobbies recently, horticulture being the latest. I like... masturbating and shrimp quite a bit.

JAKE: One of those is a hobby. The other is jerking off, and the third is just a sea creature.

AMIR: Masturbating might actually be my favorite. [chuckles]

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: Do we have, um... a hose?

JAKE: Why don't you just do your work, for the day?

AMIR: [pointing the shears at Jake] Sorry, can I ask you-- how much a week do you spend on produce?

JAKE: Don't point the s--

AMIR: [waving the shears wildly at Jake as he points] I'm serious. How much a week do you spend on produce?

JAKE: Alright. Doesn't look like you have a good grip on the shears there, so don't-- [Amir drops the shears on his desk] yeah, don't gesticulate with them like that.

AMIR: [picking up the shears, pointing them at Jake again] I really want to know, dude!

JAKE: Ten bucks.

AMIR: Wow! ...Really! That's... that's nothing! ...Where do you shop?

JAKE: How much did you spend on gardening supplies?

[There is a long, awkward silence.]

JAKE: See, at this point, I know whatever you say is a lie--

AMIR: Nine.

JAKE: --'cause you spent--

AMIR: Bucks.

JAKE: --too long.

AMIR: Dude.

[Jake stares incredulously at Amir, who waggles his eyebrows at Jake.]

AMIR: You know what? I'm sorry, but I'm not going to apologize for having a green thumb!

[Amir gives Jake a thumbs-up. His thumb is a sickly green color.]

JAKE: Oh! Too green! That's infected!

AMIR: [emptying a bag of fertilizer onto his desk and laptop] Believe it or not, I'm actually growing the ingredients one would need to make a salad!

JAKE: I don't believe that-- hey, man, that smells awful.

AMIR: It's, uh, basil, ficus... manure...

JAKE: ...Terrible salad.

AMIR: Yeah. A lot of salads actually taste like shit, but I hear they're pretty good for you. Here, look.

[Amir shoves a handful of manure into his mouth.]

JAKE: Ohh, don't! Dude, no!

AMIR: [through a mouthful of manure] This one tastes like horse manure, actually!

JAKE: That actually is horse manure!

AMIR: [with his mouth full] Sure tastes like it! [chuckles]

JAKE: It is it! 

AMIR: [chewing the manure, slightly taken aback] ...What are you talking about, man?

JAKE: Fertilizer, idiot! You're eating fertilizer!

AMIR: [with his mouth full] And?

JAKE: And it's shit! You're eating shit!

AMIR: [yelling, still with his mouth full] So why didn't you say so!

JAKE: [yelling] I did! I am!

AMIR: [yelling through manure] Before I ate it, idiot!

JAKE: [yelling] Why haven't you spit it out yet?

AMIR: [swallowing most of the manure] Because it's good for ya, see?

JAKE: ...Jesus.

AMIR: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna have some shrimp.

[Amir holds up a bowl of shrimp.]

AMIR: [drooling, grabbing a shrimp] And if you need me, I'll be in the men's room!

JAKE: You can't masturbate in the office.

AMIR: Very well, then!
