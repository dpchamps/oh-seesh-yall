INTRO Amir - You're watching an all new episode of Ace. 

Jake - Please don't. 

Amir - And Jocelyn.

Jake - I said don't. 



AMIR: Hello my fellow astronaut accountants. I've been under Jake's... uhh.... Ace's desk for the past three hours.

JAKE: Hey, is match.com down for anybody else? Cos I'm 99% sure an uggo fuggo just tried to look at my profile... and I gotta troll her. 

Amir emerges from the desk. 

AMIR: Boom! Oh... Hello Ace. It is I... Jocelyn.  

JAKE: I have time for this. 

AMIR: Well, if you got the time, then I got the shirt to show you. 

The Ace  Jocelyn theme tune plays while Amir shows the shirt at different angles. 

AMIR: Who do you think would wear this shirt, Jake... - Ace?

JAKE: Called me Jake for a second there. 

AMIR: I didn't, I said Ace! Who do you think would wear this shirt? 

JAKE: Oh my god, me alone. 

AMIR: No. Other people too. 

JAKE: You're gonna edit this like I'm -

AMIR (voiceover Jake): Chill dude!

JAKE: - aren't you? 

AMIR: The chillest. 

A cartoon of a rocket flies from the bottom of the screen to the top. A rooster crows in the background. 

AMIR: Thank you for wearing the shirt by the way, my friend. 

JAKE: I'm not wearing the - 

Scene changes to Jake lying on a couch, now wearing the new Ace  Jocelyn t-shirt. His nose is bleeding. 

JAKE: oh... dude, what the f-     

AMIR (voiceover Jake): Chill dude! 

AMIR: Awesome shirt, Ace. Where'd you get it? 

JAKE: Did you change me?

AMIR: Bustedtees.com? That sounds like a pretty sick space site. 

JAKE: You punched me in the face. 

AMIR: With a great deal!

JAKE: No, with your fists. You knocked me out. 

AMIR: With low prices. 

JAKE: Dude, did-did-did you steal my phone? 

AMIR: Ok, stop being a bitch and play along for half a second

JAKE: You stole my wallet and my phone, dude. 

AMIR: The only thing that's a steal here are these low prices. 

JAKE: Alright, that's it. 

The camera falls to the ground. Jake starts punching Amir. 

AMIR: Ow no! Ow! Stop hugging... me... Ace! 

Star wipe to reveal Amir, holding a bloodied tissue to his nose. 

JAKE: Hey Amir, I'm sorry. 

AMIR: Jocelyn. 

JAKE: Jocelyn, I'm sorry.

AMIR: Sorry, yeah.  It's fine, my nose is just bleeding from the high altitude and low prices heh... ow... that hurts. 

JAKE: Ok, I lost my cool, ok? Any way I can make it up to you? 

Scene wipe to reveal Jake sitting on a couch with a script in front of him. 

AMIR: Rolling!

JAKE: Oh my god, don't sound like you're crying all the time, Jesus.

AMIR: Just start!

JAKE: Houston, we have a problem! These shirts are too fat. 

AMIR: With emotion!

JAKE: These shirts are so hot, they're practically on fire. 

AMIR: Ok, great. 

He approaches Jake with a lighter. Jake protests. A new scene appears with Jake's shirt half burned off of him. The scene is badly edited by Amir. (each dash represents a new piece of footage from the clip)

JAKE: You're - amazing. You're fu- amazing. And you know what else man? This shirt, it's - amazing. You know who's going to buy one of these? - Everybody. - You got that? 

AMIR: I got that, Ace. I got that. 

AMIR: Here we go... oh ah ah ah ah! Hmm... early. I'll start on that. Ok, 3... 2... 1... oh ah ah ah ah! DAMNIT! Ok, forget it.
