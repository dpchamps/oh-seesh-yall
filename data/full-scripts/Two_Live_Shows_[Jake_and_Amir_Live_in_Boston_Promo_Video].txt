Jake: Hey there, everybody! We wanted to let you know that we are coming to Boston.

Amir: (grabs Jake) LET'S GO SOX!

Jake: Don't touch me! And stop doing that. Tickets are on sale now for our show at the House of Blues in Boston, Massachusetts on Tuesday, November 15, at 8 PM.

Amir: MANNY RAMIREZ! (laughs)

Jake: Got traded, and is now retired.

Amir: Okay.

Jake: So go to livenation.com, and get your tickets, come to the show, and it will be a lot of fun!

Amir: (sings part of Baseball, Charge! theme) Charge! (pretend swings bat) The 2030 Chicago White Sox are your ALCS MVPs!

Jake: Was that who you've been talking about?

Amir: ..What?
