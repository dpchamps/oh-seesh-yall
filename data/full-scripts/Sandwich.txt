Jake sits down at his desk with a sandwich.

AMIR: Whoa, what is that? Tell me right now.

JAKE: Calm down, it's a sandwich. 

AMIR: No shit Sherlock, what kind?

JAKE: Not that it's any of your business--

AMIR: Incorrect. You're supposed to keep digging Watson. Continue.

JAKE: Mayo.

AMIR: Ooh.

JAKE: Mozzarella.

AMIR: Mustard.

JAKE: Mozzarella cheese.

AMIR: Provolone, my favesies. 

JAKE: And a veggie burger.

AMIR: Pizza.

JAKE: No, none of those things. 

AMIR: Ooh, I'm sorry brotha. 

JAKE: Don't be.

AMIR: That is mine, that is definitely my sandwich. 

JAKE: It's not.

AMIR: No questions asked.

JAKE: You're right, no questions asked. My sandwich.

AMIR: Listen, ask anybody in here that knows me, they'll tell you zat one is definitely my sandwich.

JAKE: I'm the only one here that knows you, and I'm telling you that it's my sandwich.

AMIR: It shouldn't even come to this. 

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: (Laughs) I mean, this is insane! It's so--

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: It's clear to me whose sandwich it belongs to.

JAKE: (Laughs) Me too, yeah.

AMIR: I wasn't even going to do this, but I will trade you my food for yours. 

JAKE: You don't bring food to work.

Amir holds up a container of sprinkles and a container of cake frosting.

AMIR: Oh, really? Okay, so sprinkles, frosting. Choose ONE! But not both.

JAKE: I'll choose neither.

AMIR: Okay, good, 'cause these are gonna go great on my sandwich.

JAKE: You're not getting the sandwich.

AMIR: Jake, listen to me. Joking aside, I need that sandwich. I haven't eaten in several days. Just, please, I'm begging you. 

JAKE: Oh, god, I know you're serious. Here. 

Jake starts to pass Amir the sandwich.

AMIR: (Laughs) Oh it appears as if the prankee has become the pranker. I have eaten in the last few days, and you know what? You ain't gettin' that sandwich back.

JAKE: Said that a little early, didn't you? Now I'm not gonna give you the sandwich.

AMIR: W-w-w-w-wait! I'll sell it to you for a joke.

Jake shrugs.

JAKE: Shut up. 

AMIR: What's the difference between procrastination and masturbation?

Jake starts eating the sandwich.

AMIR: You're fucking yourself over. 

Jake shrugs.

AMIR: Both times.
