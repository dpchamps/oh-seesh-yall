(At airport, waiting at terminal)

Amir (showing Jake candy bars): Pick your poison! (laughs)

Jake: You're 25, you really need to start eating like an adult.

Amir: I just, if I ate any more than three my stomach would start to hurt.

Jake: Ok, not what I meant. 

Amir: Can I ask you a personal question?

Jake: No.

Amir: I don't think we should go to Florida. 

Jake: Not personal, not a question, and I said no, so...

Amir: It's just, if we're going for the sandwiches, my uncle owns a deli and he can hook us up royal if we stay in New York. 

Jake: Alright, what are you talking about?

Amir: My cousin works for a Subway.

Jake: So just say that. We're not going for the sandwiches, we're going for the beach.

Amir: That's true. I just, truth is I'm afraid of flying. I've never been on an airplane before.

Jake: Just relax, it's going to be fine. 

Amir: You're right. We can get through this together. (tries to hug Jake)

Jake (avoiding hug): You can get through this alone.

Amir: (on plane) Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god-

Jake: Just relax. We're in the air. There's nothing you can do. 

Amir: There's always something you can do.

Jake: Don't.

Amir: (yelling) There's a fucking bomb on the plane, everybody hit the fucking floor now! 

Amir (back at terminal, implied they were kicked off the plane): We should just take a train, man. 

Jake: We already bought stand-by tickets for the next flight.

Amir: Trust me, a train will be faster. I can do that like ten more times.
