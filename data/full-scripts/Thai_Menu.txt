[Intro]

Jake: Hey you're watching Jake and Ami-

[THUD]

Amir: Ow! I'm sorry, are you okay?

Jake: Oh! I'm bleeding

[Amir sits alone at a desk holding his legs above his head, he holds a lighter between his legs and flicks it on]

Amir: Aw yeah, [Sings the baseball home run sound effect] Come on baby one time!

[Jake enters and Amir sits down properly. Jake slams a large file down on the desk and sits down next to him]

Jake: Hey! Do you mind explaining this?

Amir: This? Oh that's [laughs] that is a menu to a Thai food restaurant

Jake: That's what this is?

Amir: Yiiiis

Jake: Okay cool. Um, you can actually just say Thai restaurant, you don't have to say Thai food restaurant it accomplishes the exact same thing

Amir: [laughs again] Oh yeah! I guess you're right. Okay, Peace out!

Jake: [mockingly] Peace out!

Amir: Peace in the middle ea-

Jake: Because I thought what this was was a complete comprehensive list of every single outfit I've ever worn since I started working here

Amir: No.

Jake: No?

Amir: No no, it's not.

Jake: [While grabbing the first page from under Amir's hand] Do you mind if I refer to the first page here?

Amir: Yah!

Jake: Because here... [Amir clicks the lighter a few times and Jake grabs it from his hand and throws it across the room] The first 'item' on your menu isn't like pad Thai or spring rolls it's December 3rd Jake is wearing blue jeans, yellow belt, grey hoodie and white shoes. With a smiley face, so

Amir: Okay, can we backtrack for like, half a second? I have a feeling that you can say Thai Food restaurant, you know what I mean? Yes it does sound a little redundant but I think, like I've heard Leron once-

Jake: This is seriously fucking disturbing Amir! I know you're a weirdo. I get that! You're stupid, you're a moron, you're creepy, you're freakishly obsessed with me but this crosses the line. It's seriously fucked, it is. It's [Stutters the word 'It' repeatedly]

Amir: IT'S IT'S IT'S TODAY JUNIOR!

[Silence for almost a minute. Amir dances, makes noises and tries to high five Jake during the silence]

Amir: [Putting his hand onto the file] I'm gonna get rid of this

Jake: No I'm gonna get rid of it

Amir: DON'T FUCKING TOUCH IT
