INTRO:

JAKE: You are watching Jake and Amir!

AMIR: Not yet!

JAKE: Yes, yet.

AMIR: Oh.



[Streeter is talking to a group of CollegeHumor employees, some of whom are laying on the ground in push-up position, the rest of whom are standing in a circle around them.]

STREETER: Alright everyone, it's time for a push-up contest! Now you guys know the rules, alright? Everybody's got a counter, you gotta go all the way down, and no girl push-ups. Alright, ready?

AMIR: (interrupting) Yeah yeah and FOLLOW-UP rule, everyone!--

STREETER: Ready, set, GO! (cheering and clapping begins)

AMIR: Uh, everyone has to have fun!

(Jake stops doing push-ups and sits up.)

(Amir pants and clears his throat, then stands up. He clears his throat again.)

AMIR: Ok, so, that was... nine, I think. I wasn't.. I wasn't completely counting, but who did more than nine? Just as like a.. (He points around the room; no one reacts.) Did you? You? No? Cuz you weren't.. So nobody. Alright! Ah. We win!
