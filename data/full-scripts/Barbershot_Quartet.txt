INTRO

AMIR: You're watching Zack and Amir!

JAKE: Jake and Amir.

AMIR: Okay, we don't want to spoonfeed the audience.



[Amir and three others are dressed up as a barbershop quartet.]

QUARTET: [singing very off-key with each other] Bluuue moooooooon, you saw me standing alo-o-o-o-o-one...

[Jake walks in, plugging his ears.]

QUARTET: [singing] Without a love...

JAKE: Sorry-- just-- shut up. All of you just shut up.

AMIR: [The rest have stopped singing] ...of my owwwwwwwwn-- guys, you gotta work through that, okay? We're gonna be heckled a lot harder than that, protesting the kindergartners' graduation tonight...

JAKE: You're an asshole.

AMIR: Why is it when you pick up a hobby, you're, like, a nice guy, but when I do it, I'm an asshole?

JAKE: I have this theory that you're, like, such a bad combination of mean-spirited and dumb that everything you do makes you an asshole.

AMIR: Are you just mad at me because I haven't done any work in the last couple days?

JAKE: Yes.

AMIR: Or is it that I'm so good at singing now--

JAKE: It's the first one.

AMIR: --that it makes everything you do seem--... what's the word I'm thinking of? Uh, I-- I'm so good at something, that you are now...

JAKE: It's the work one.

AMIR: ...bad.

JAKE: Bad. Wow, that was the word you were looking for? It was bad?

AMIR: 'Cuz if it's the first one--

JAKE: It is.

AMIR: --I'll shut up...

JAKE: Thank you.

AMIR: ...but if it's the second one--

JAKE: I'm so surprised at how many times I've had to tell you it's the first one.

AMIR: Okay, fine, new rule, then: if it's the first one, we're good. But if it's the second one, it's the opposite of good. It's, um...

LERRENCE: Bad!

AMIR: Don't butt in, Lerrence.

JAKE: Sorry--... who named you Lerrence?

LERRENCE: A fisherman found me when I was nineteen years old. He named me Lerrence, and he raised me.

JAKE: You know, by nineteen, you really should've been pretty much raised.

LERRENCE: Yeah, but--

JAKE: And named.

LERRENCE: That's fair. That's more then fair.

AMIR: Okay-- will all jealous parties just vacate the room? Or I'll make-make the boom.

[There is a very long pause. Eventually, a member of the quartet dejectedly walks out the door. Jake and the remaining trio stand in silence.]

JAKE: Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave too, but, um... I'm not jealous.

[The trio has begun singing again.]

TRIO: [singing] She's my little deuce coupe! She don't knowww what I got-- little doop-boop-bidda-budda-d'I got...

JAKE: Yeah, there's a crowd of people booing you guys outside.

TRIO: We know.



END



[Jake has joined the quartet.]

QUARTET: [singing] There she was, just a-walkin' down the street, singin' [very off-key] Doo-wa-diddy-diddy-dum-diddy-doo! Snappin' her fingers...

[The self-exiled quartet member watches longingly from outside.]
