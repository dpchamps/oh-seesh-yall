Jake is sitting at table. Amir comes in with a bag over his head shrieking.

JAKE: Jesus Christ!

Amir takes the bag off of his head.

AMIR: (Laughing) I'm just kidding. Not that you'd even care if I tried to kill me. Would you?

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Okay. Let's start from the ze-top. Filling out our men's basketball bracket. I'll start. Division I Men's Bracket Opening Round Game vs. March 18th. Who ya got?

JAKE: Let's start lower with an actual team. North Carolina vs. Mount St. Mary.

AMIR: 16 - 1 already. So, once you're up 20, there's no going back. I'd be a fool to go for North Carolina in this situation. M T S T Mary, thank you.

JAKE: Okay, you can't do math. Also, this isn't a scoreboard. These are their seeds.

AMIR: Okay. Not gonna change my pick.

JAKE: You are though. I'm watching you.

AMIR: (Covering his bracket) Don't cheat.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: What'd you get for Indiana?

JAKE: I just wrote Indiana.

AMIR: Me too. (Amir scribbles something)

JAKE: No, you're drawing a picture of me.

AMIR: How can you tell?

JAKE: Because the hair's.

AMIR: Because the pearly white teeth.

JAKE: Stop.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Moving on. By U vs. Texas A (Jake mouths BYU) and M. So it's two teams against one, it would be a sucker's bet to go for anybody but these Texas teams.

JAKE: You know you're an idiot, but I got Texas AM too, so.

AMIR: Texas A or M? Okay, you can't (laughs) have them both, okay. So, I'll take Baylor and Perda over Zav-. How do you - when a word starts with an x, what is that?

[Jump cut]

AMIR: You smell super good today by the way bro.

JAKE: C'mon.

AMIR: What?!

JAKE: That.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: St. Mary's and then also Mount St. Mary's. So, this bracket's already busted, right? So. Let me tear it and we'll start it from there. (Amir begins tearing his bracket)

JAKE: Ok, Those - there are two St. Mary's teams.

AMIR: Okay, that's fine. I'll just tape it back together. It's not the first time I made that mistake.

JAKE: You can tell.

AMIR: What. Barely.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Oral Roberts (Laughs) What is that - Is that team about having butt sex with each other?

JAKE: That's immature and the wrong innuendo.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Baylor, straight to da final tree.

JAKE: It's final four.

AMIR: Not when you're that good. From way downtown. (Throws pen across room like a basketball) Ah sheesh, can I borrow your pen?

[Jump cut]

Amir is circling something.

AMIR: From way downtown. (Throws pen across the room like a basketball again)

JAKE: C'mon.

[Jump cut]

Amir is now holding a pink highlighter.

AMIR: We should write a movie about two guys that predict scores.

JAKE: It's already a movie.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Texas versus Austin P. Ooo I like Austin P. (does an Austin Powers impression) in the final four baby, yeah!

JAKE: It's not very likely.

AMIR: (Still doing Austin Powers impression) Oh does that prediction make you horny?

JAKE: It makes me sad.

AMIR: Same th- Same thing.

[Jump cut]

JAKE: Do you even have the $5 buy in?

AMIR: Um, nay. But, I have a feeling Mr. Hamilton (takes out $5 bill) will persuade the bracket masta.

Jake takes $5 bill from Amir and throws it on the table. Amir quickly snatches it back.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Lightning round! UCLA! (Amir is scribbling something)

JAKE: You're just drawing lightning.

AMIR: Or whatever.

JAKE: Not or whatever. You are.

AMIR: San Diego. (Draws something and looks at Jake)

JAKE: Write it!

AMIR: That's a chill bolt.

[Jump cut]

Amir is laughing hysterically.

AMIR: Oral Roberts.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Alright, this is taking way too long. (To Jake) We got dinner to go to.

JAKE: We don't.

[Jump cut]

AMIR: Finals. San Antonio vs. who?

JAKE: The finals are in San Antonio. You need to pick two teams.

AMIR: Alright. (Amir writes something and looks at Jake)

JAKE: It's Jake. Jake wins it all.

AMIR: Sorry. I thought that's where we put our name.

JAKE: It's my name.

AMIR: It's our name.

[Jump cut]

Jake gets up from his chair.

AMIR: Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait. Just tell me- How do you pronounce this: Day-u-k-e?

[Jump cut]

AMIR: West Vir - There's a West Virginia?
