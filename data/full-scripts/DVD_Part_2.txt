[Non-POV. Jake, Pat, and Amir are at a table. This episode begins at the end of the previous one.]

JAKE: Okay, here's what happened:



[POV: Jake. Jake is doing push-ups on the floor. He looks up at Rosie as he does them.]

JAKE: How many is that?

ROSIE: That's at least a thousand. I've never seen anything like this, Jake!

JAKE: What do my tri's look like?

ROSIE: They're ginormous, man!

[They hear loud, disruptive clamor at the door.]

JAKE: Aw, dammit! Amir's here.

ROSIE: Ugh. Awful.

[Jake opens the door. Amir is there, wearing only shorts.]

JAKE: What.

AMIR: 'Sup!

[Amir slaps him, and laughs.]

JAKE: Aah. God, I hate that.

AMIR: Hey, guys!

[Amir attempts to kick off his flip-flops. They fly in weird directions.]

JAKE: Okay. Make yourself at home, right?

AMIR: [singing] It's my dick in a box!

JAKE: Stop.

[Amir waves his arms in a way not at all suggesting a box.]

AMIR: It's my dick in a box, baby!

[Amir gets really close to Jake as he sings. Jake pushes him away by the face.]

JAKE: Stop it!

AMIR: ...Sorry.

JAKE: You know, me and Rosie were trying to hang out by ourselves, okay? Can't you let us be alone for five seconds? You know how much I dislike you?

ROSIE: It's true.

[Amir turns to look at a DVD sitting beside him.]

AMIR: Whoa! What the hell is this? It's like a book... but it's... super-light. Who's Knocke Dup?

[Amir opens it.]

JAKE: It's a DVD, alright? I borrowed it from Patrick Cassels, and he was gracious enough to let me borrow it. Don't mess it up.

AMIR: I'm going to break it.

JAKE: Why?

AMIR: Because I'm a retard. That's why.



[Non-POV. Present.]

AMIR: That is not what I said!

JAKE: Okay, it's my story, right? So let me tell it: and he was doing the high voice and everything. He was like, [in Amir's high-pitched voice] I'm gonna break your DVD! I'm going to break your DVD.

PAT: Jake, I don't care about that. Just tell me what happened to my DVD.

JAKE: Cassels, I'm getting there.



[POV: Jake. Past.]

JAKE: I'm asking you politely: please calm down.

AMIR: Okay, after I break it, I wanna have a sleepover with you, and we can discuss-- all night-- how much we hate Pat.

JAKE: Don't even ask that, okay? You know the answer.

[Amir begins bending the DVD.]

AMIR: Jake. Look how bendy it is.

JAKE: Jesus Christ...

AMIR: I'm so stupid!



[Non-POV. Present.]

JAKE: And then he just broke it in half.

AMIR: [sigh] Did that redheaded homo put you up to this?

PAT: Don't bring Rosie into this. He's too dumb to defend himself.

JAKE: Y'know, Rosie was there! Why don't we ask him?

PAT: Fine. Rosie, what happened?

[Pan to show that Rosie has been at the table as well, the whole time.]

ROSIE: Well...
