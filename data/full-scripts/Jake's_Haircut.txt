Amir: Question. 
Jake: Is it about work? 
Amir: Nn..mm..kind of. 
Jake: So not at all then. 
Amir: How the FUCK could you get a haircut? 
Jake: ...How? 
Amir: I mean...are you surprised with how I'm reacting to this?
Jake: I wanna be. I really do. Unfortunately, this is normal for you. 
Amir: This is--this is--this is normal for me, right? This is normal for me?
Jake: What are you angry? 
Amir: No. ...No, I'm not angry. (shrugs) I'm not angry at all. I'm fucking livid! 
Jake: Why are you freaking out? 
Amir: I don't know, I mean, psh, does the phrase matching haircut club mean anything to you? 
Jake: No. 
Amir: No. Eh, eh, eh, eh, (almost a coughing noise, with a head tilt each time) 
Jake: You okay? 
Amir: Eh, eh. No, you know what? Yeah, I'm okay. This is good. This is good--now I know. 
Jake: I'm gonna get a soda. Try to relax, calm down. 
Amir: Piggy front. 
Jake: What? 
Amir: Piggy front. Right now. (jumps on top of Jake)
Jake: What are you doing? Oh God. 
Amir: We're even. 
Jake: Fine. 
Amir: BUT, you have to take me to Supercuts after work because I'm saying that I want this exact length--
Jake: Don't touch it.
