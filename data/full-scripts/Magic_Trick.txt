Amir: You think you know, but you have no idea...

Jake: They probably have an idea.

Amir: Okay, congratulations, Einstein (pronounced Einsteen).



[Amir stands at a table where he has three red cups and a ball set up. Jake is walking nearby.]

Amir: Jake, step right up! See if you can follow the ball! All you have to do is follow that ball, follow that ball... See if you can follow it... follow it... Go.

Jake: Are you even trying to do magic? The middle cup.

Amir: Wrong. It's the right one.

Jake: Oh, wow... That's impressive! I have to go back to work now; I have to do actual work 'cause we have real jobs. Do it one more time.

Amir: Okay, here we go. Ball is in the right cup. [Jake: All right, just go.] Movin' it around a little... Keep your eye on the pry! Which cup is it in?

Jake: Okay, I get it now. Pretty simple, man. Right cup.

Amir: Wrong. Left cup.

Jake: Wow, congratulations! The world's first retarded musician!

Amir: Musician, or magician?

Jake: Okay, I said magician, buttfuck; just do it again.

Amir: All right. [Sarah enters.] Step right up. See if you can follow the ball. And... where is it?

Sarah: Center cup!

Jake: Wow, I thought so too, but I'm a little bit smarter than you. Right cup.

Amir: Ah, Sarah was right; it's in the center cup.

Sarah: Thank you!

Jake: Okay...

Sarah: Oh, I totally get it! (goes to whisper to Amir)

Amir: (laughs) Yeah, that's it.

Sarah: (laughs) Can I kiss the magician?

Amir: (laughs) Yeah, sure. (smooched by Sarah)

Jake: Do it again.

Amir: All right, just one last time though, 'cause I think you're getting a little too pissed or whatever. Just—All right, it's in the right one, right? Follow that ball. Follow that ball... All right, where is it?

Jake: Okay, well, I know it's not in th—(knocks over cups in frustration) DAMN IT! COME ON! ...My fault, my fault. Do it again.

Amir: All right, hey, but.. honestly, this is the last time, right? In the center, okay? (moves cups) ...Go.

Jake: That one right there.

Amir: Which one?

Jake: Middle.

Amir: (picks up cup, smiling) Yeah, it's in the middle.

Jake: ...No, FUCK IT, I was guessing. (grunts, then kicks bin filled with play pen balls)

Amir: Okay, hey, hey, hey, look, look, look, okay? They're cut. They're cut open in the back. I just move them—[Jake: Oh...] I move from behind, all right? That's how it works. It's not magic; it's just... cut open from behind, and... it's real.. yeah.. simple, right?



[Scene cuts to Jake performing the same trick at Sarah's desk.]

Jake: So then the trick is that there are these slits in the back of the cup. And you had to figure it out, it's pretty tough, but I did it. Kiss for the magician? (leans to Sarah)

Sarah: No...
