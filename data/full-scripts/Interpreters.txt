(Sam is sat next to Amir at his desk, unless otherwise noted, Amir is whispering into Sam's ear throughout) 

SAM: Jake!

JAKE: Sam. 

SAM: Sup!? It's Amir. 

JAKE: It's what?

SAM: You said I couldn't talk to you for the rest of the day, and that's fine because Sam is going to speak for me, so...

JAKE: Awesome.  

SAM: Dinnah tonight? I'm thinking--What is she doing here? 

(Jake is now whispering into Sarah's ear)

SARAH: Sarah is going to be talking for me. 

SAM: Ha-ha. Yeah right. 

SARAH: Right. 

SAM: LOL (high pitched) What'd you think you're doing? (cuts quickly to Jake whispering to Sarah before going back) What'd you think you're doing? (normal) Jake, what do you think--

SARAH: --You're doing. Got it. 

SAM: Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake--

SARAH: WHAT?

SAM: I just do nay think this ugly b-i-t-c-h should be talking for you, you are way too good looking. Straight up. 

SARAH: Hey! Sarah is the prettiest girl at the office. (pause-Jake whispers again) So, just shut up. 

SAM: Wow, you're just saying that because you have a crush on her. 

SARAH: Ha. No way. 

SAM: So why did you specifically ask to be her Secret Santa this year? (Sam adds under his breath) Really? 

SARAH: Maybe because I didn't. Amir, stop it. 

SAM: And why did you spend all day Sunday finding her a first edition copy of her favorite childhood book: Where ze Wild ziings Aren't? 

SARAH: Where the Wild Things Are. 

SAM: Is it? 

SARAH: And I would never buy that...gay-ass book? 

(Sarah get up and storms over to Sam to whisper in his ear)

SAM: Hey, Jake, don't talk to me for the rest of the week. (pause) Make that ever! You can give that gay-ass book to somebody else! 

(Sarah runs off crying)

AMIR: Wow. That. was. EPIC! (chuckles) Oh my god, Sarah F-T-dub--

SAM: (to Amir) Hey! Hey! Hey! Through me. 

(Amir leans over to whisper to Sam)

SAM: Wow, that was EPIC! 

THE END.
