Amir: What are you doing?  

Jake: Trying to hide from you.  

Amir: That's weird.  

Amir: [rapping] Yo so-  

Jake: DON'T!  

Amir: [rapping] Yo so, when it snows my feet they bleed cuz my shoes have holes  I can nay afford socks-o.  

Jake: Why do you thinly veil these depressing anecdotes in raps? You're still saying it, you know?  

Amir: (making a face)  

Jake: DON'T! I can tell you're gonna rap by the face you're making.  

Amir: [rapping] Sometimes when it's super cold out and raining and stuff, I order chinese food and when it comes I don't tip the guy. I just take the food and kick him in the chest. When he lands on the floor I just lock him out, I don't pay for the food or pay for the tip. I make him regret stuff like his life, his job and shee-ot like that-su.  

Jake: [trying to rap] Oh, yo it's like everything you say is still a thing and it holds weight and it's inappropriate for the work place uh, or anywhere really, you should, or you'll never be kicking anyone in the chest.  

Amir: [rapping] I spent last week in a hospital. What I thought was Flintstones vitamins was actually birth control and I shouldn't have drank the whole botty bottle but I did.  

Jake: I don't think birth control comes in a bottle.  

Amir: [rapping] Oh sheesh ya'll t'was a dream!  

Jake: Was it really?  

Amir: [rapping] Nay, it actually happened and it cost me a lot of grief and money.  

Jake: Are you okay?  

Amir: [rapping] Just a little queasy, I should take it easy.  

Jake: STOP! Do you need to go home?  

Amir: Yeah probably, idk, I still feel a little poisoned. Ya know?
