INTRO

JAKE: You're watching Jake and Amir, and why are you calling me?

AMIR: To talk!



AMIR: Sorry, who are we waiting for?

JAKE: Nobody, he's here.

BEN: Hi.

AMIR: Ahh!

BEN: (opens arms) Welcome, to my office.

AMIR: This is your office?

BEN: No, come on.

AMIR: (imitates hand motion) But, you went like that.

BEN: (points to elbows) I was just stretching these parts of my arms.

AMIR: The elbows?

BEN: I don't know what they're called, but I was stretching them.

AMIR: In addition to the movement, you said welcome to my office.

BEN: I don't remember what I said, who knows what I said, Jake brought me here.

JAKE: I didn't bring you here.

BEN: You sure did. I was holding like 30 bags of Funyuns and I couldn't get into my pockets again. So you took out your security card. (Jake shakes his head) No, right? I brought me here. (winks)

AMIR: What was that?

BEN: That was a wink.

AMIR: You winked at Jake.

BEN: Yeah, because Jake brought me here.

JAKE: Come on

BEN: Listen, I'm the head of H.R., right? (Jake nods) And the reason I am here is to deal with your terrible, terrible smell.

AMIR: You look so familiar.

BEN: I don't think so.

AMIR: What is your? Sorry, I was still talking, what is your name?

BEN: My name? Is that what you want to know? (AMIR: Yeah.) Because I'm a totally different person that you've ever seen. My name is...Fm-mm...



FLASHBACK

JAKE: Most important rule when we're in there: If he asks you your name, don't hesitate.

BEN: I never hesitate, I'm amazing at thinking of new names.

JAKE: No, you're not that good.

BEN: I'm amazing, unique names.

JAKE: Alright, practice. What's your name?

BEN: My name is Qu-Qu-Crowlidit-Cowlideen? San.

JAKE: See, this is a good example of stuttering, making up a name.

BEN: Mmmm...

JAKE: This is not good, Ok, think of a name before we go in, that's all I'm saying.

BEN: I got one, I got one in my back pocket. I just memorized it.

JAKE: What is it?

BEN: My name?

JAKE: Yeah?

BEN: Se-Shannon-Shoonith?

JAKE: Then you didn't just memorize it, Ok, look, if you need to, just use the name, Jim. Ok?

BEN: Not gonna have to.

JAKE: Alright, but just in case you can't think of something-

BEN: Don't think of a just in case, I'll just use what I got.

JAKE: Alright, what's your name?

BEN: My name? Ask me what my name is.

JAKE: I just did. What is your name.



BEN: Ask me my name?

AMIR: I just did. I said, what's your name?

BEN: My name is... Shhhsscaal-

JAKE: Jim!

BEN: Nope. I know what my name is. My name is Scalby...Scalby-Lawfsoos.

AMIR: Scalby-Lawfsoos?

BEN: is my fist name, my last name is... Jim.

JAKE: Can we talk about what we came here to talk about?

BEN: Yeah, absolutely. Amir, you stink. Ugh, you stink.

AMIR: At what?

BEN: At just smelling bad.

AMIR: So I smell good?

BEN: Yuck, I messed that up. I messed that up. There's only one thing to do. (standing up) Jake, I'm going rogue.



FLASHBACK

JAKE: Ok, just promise me one thing. Don't go rogue.

BEN: I don't even know what that means, what does it mean to go rogue?

JAKE: That's good, don't worry about it. Just don't stray. Ok?

BEN: Hey, don't worry. This Joe won't be Rogen.

JAKE: That was bad.

BEN: Seth won't be Rogen.

JAKE: Even worse, Ok, just stay on topic, is what I'm saying.



JAKE: Don't go rogue!

BEN: It's too late, I'm roguein' right now.

JAKE: You said you didn't even know what it meant!

BEN: I said a lot of things, I ate all those Funyuns, I didn't throw them out. You ready? Take off your clothes.

JAKE: (Amir starts taking shirt off) Hey, hey, stop, look. If he blindly follows your instructions, just tell him to shower.

BEN: I can't do that, this is way smarter.

JAKE: (standing up) Ok, I'm gonna go.

BEN: No, don't go, this is the best part!

AMIR: Jake!

JAKE: (tries to turn handle) We're locked in.

BEN: (gasps)

AMIR: (gasps)

JAKE: (gasps)

AMIR: (pause, laughs)

BEN: Huh!

JAKE: Ugh.

AMIR: (farts)

BEN: (signature Ben Scwartz whale-laugh)
