(Jake is shopping at J. Crew)

Amir: (Hops around Jake) Or whatever.

Jake: I'm not going to make a scene, just leave.

Amir: I'm leaving right now.  Lets just shop together for a few hours. Wow!

(Amir holds up a red polo on a hanger.  Amir is also wearing a red polo)

Amir: (Holding up a red polo, while also wearing a red polo) Jake. Gay.

Amir: (Looking through a pile of women's orange sweaters) Gay. Gay.

Jake: It's all the same women's sweater.

(Amir is randomly dancing in the middle of the store)

(Jake is looking in a mirror while trying on a shirt)

Amir: You have to think about what it would look like if both of us were wearing one.

Jake: No I don't.

Amir: (Puts his arm around Jake) Whatever.

Jake: Get off of me. It's $350 anyway I can't afford it.

Amir: So that's $900 for both of us. Let do it.

Jake: Not quite.

(Jake and Amir are in an elevator)

Amir: Security is going to be, pretty pissed.

Jake: Why?

Amir: (Pulls sandal out of sweater) Oh I dunno.

Jake: (Takes sandal and puts it on) That's mine.

Amir: Yes. But.

(Back to Jake in front of mirror)

Jake: How can you afford $900 for a jacket when I can't?

Amir: I dunno Jake, it's called calling your Dad and telling him your girlfriend is in the hospital so you have to send her a gift. I mean, you're 23 years old...

Jake: 22

Amir: (Kisses Jake on the cheek) ...figure it out.

(Jake and Amir leave the store.  Amir jumps on Jake's back. Jake drops Amir on the ground)

Amir: You owe me dinner!
