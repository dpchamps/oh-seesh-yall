AMIR: LOL, you know what I hate??

JAKE: Parks, beaches, museums . . . ?

AMIR: Paying at the pump. ?

JAKE: (sigh)

AMIR: And Americans are doing it in record numbers. ?

JAKE: OK, do you even know what that means??

AMIR: What? Like, instead of cash, you pay...you pump it, or whatever.?

JAKE: I don't know how Diana puts up with you.  

AMIR: Diana, your cousin and my fiance.?

JAKE: What?! You guys are getting married?

?AMIR: What?! What did she say to you? I'm not ready to be a dad!?

JAKE: She didn't say anything. You just said she was your fiance. ?

AMIR: Oh! (laughs) I don't know what th-I don't know what that means.  Anyway, she's coming over soon for our hot date, and we may look very tired so don't mention anything, just ignore us. ?

JAKE: OK, I usually do. 

?AMIR: OK, let me finish. We look tired because (high pitched) we were up all night. 

?JAKE: Oh.My.God.

?AMIR: (singing) All night long. 

?JAKE: Don't.

?AMIR: Jake. We were basically all night holding each other. I'm her cuddle buddy, it's stupid. 

?JAKE: I guess that's better.?

AMIR: All right, now shut the fuck up, I think I hear her! Remember, just to recap, we're in love and I don't steal coins from other people's desks. 

?JAKE: Fine. 

?AMIR: They should call me Mario, I jack so many coin-o's. 

??(Diana approaches) ?

AMIR: That's no coin-o's, that's no coin-o's. ?

JAKE: OK, now you need to shut up. ?

AMIR: Debatable--oh--?

DIANA: Hey.

?AMIR: Hey! My princess Diana, you're more alive than she'll ever be. (attempts to kiss her cheek) Still made contact, you saw that. ?

JAKE: Yeah.?

AMIR: All right, I'm going to go get changed, you guys talk amongst yourselves. ?

DIANA: OK.

?AMIR: (whispers to Jake) Be nice! 

?(Amir runs off to back of shot, begins struggling to dress)

?DIANA: Jake.

?JAKE: Jesus.

?DIANA: I need you to break up with Amir for me. ?

JAKE: What???

DIANA: He's crazy! I can't do it myself. 

?AMIR: ...OWW!!?

DIANA: Did you know that he only eats Chicken McNuggets?

?JAKE: Yeah.

?DIANA: No, I mean, only eats Chicken McNuggets. Nothing else! Not even water. ? 

JAKE: I said 'Yeah'.?

DIANA: He came to my house this weekend. ?

JAKE: OK, what's the big deal?

?DIANA: In California. How did he even get there?!?

JAKE: (sighs) I wish I knew. 

?DIANA: He's putting on that penguin suit right now, isn't he?

?JAKE: I don't know. ?

AMIR: Jake.?

JAKE: Look, I know he's weird, but look, Diana, you have to-you have to do this yourself, OK? He's sensitive. ?

DIANA: I-I can't, I'm sorry, you have to do this for me, Jake. Thanks. Lunch this weekend? (she leaves) ?

(Amir returns...quacking)? 

AMIR: Where is she? (nervous chuckle)

?JAKE: Amir...

?AMIR: What happened??

JAKE: I need to talk to you. ?

AMIR: (puts on penguin hood) What about?
