INTRO
JAKE: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
AMIR: Alright, trick, don't kill my vibe.
JAKE: Stop it.
AMIR: I'm serious!
START
AMIR: I'm on a bus and, it's going fast and...
JAKE: You know the only reason we're on this bus is cause you got us kicked off the train for pretending to be a conductor.
AMIR: That's not how the rap goes.
AMIR: I feel like busses are for people who can't afford shit. Like whips and shit.
JAKE: I don't know where you get this false sense of entitlement, but you also can't afford shit.
AMIR: Yeah well except my dad had an Audi. So thanks for playing!
JAKE: He had an Audi?
AMIR: Yeah, he really did, he had an Audi!
JAKE: Like he used to own an Audi?
AMIR: No like he leased an Audi. Leased to own an Audi.
JAKE: What you did was a felony.
AMIR: Oh no, lock me up and throw away the key!
JAKE: That's what they would do!
AMIR: Really? That's bad news actually cause I wouldn't last a day in jail.
JAKE: You stood outside the train yelling "all awhored," and then once the doors shut you said "Everyone listen up this is an emergency, there's Anthrax on the train, take off all your clothes."
AMIR: It was a goof!
JAKE: You're a goof.
AMIR: Excuse me. I have very thick skin but that was a low blow.
JAKE: You're a goof?
AMIR: ENOUGH!
(Amir is flashing his nipples outside the window)
JAKE: Hey, hey, that's a toddler dude!
AMIR: This is what's up. This is why I don't needs to rides the bus.
JAKE: You know you're currently on the bus, which is, you know, not a great place to brandish your eleven dollars.
AMIR: I flaunts it cause I don't needs it. And I don't give a sh- OH! OH NO!
JAKE: What are you listening to?
AMIR: IT'S NIGGERS IN PARIS. NIGGERS IN-
JAKE: I GOT IT.
JAKE: The police showed up and you said you were a Jon Stewart type comedian making a point about subway culture. You said you were a political activist rising up against this see something, say nothing bull sheeite. A mix between Che Guevara, Bam Margera, and Dom Irrera. And then you said "I'm part of the sixty-nine percent." And when nobody laughed, you started crying.
AMIR: Do you know what that means? I feel like if you knew what that meant, the sixty-nine thing, you'd be cracking up.
JAKE: I know what that is.
AMIR: Not the number, ass. It's a sex thing. Okay, it's when a girl eats your butt. Sixty-nine.
AMIR: You're poor. You're poor. Y'all are poor. And I'm a rich bitch.
JAKE: You're a bitch?
AMIR: I'm not a bitch. I'm rich.
AMIR: How's your summer been?
JAKE: Fine.
AMIR: Fine. I knew you'd give a fricken' one word answer and I knew you'd say fine, and to prove it, I wrote it down on a piece of paper before I left my apartment this morning. Exhibit A!
JAKE: This says "Urinals are for pee-pee, toilets are for doo-doo."
AMIR: Other side then.
JAKE: It's a bunch of drafts of one liners. The last one being "I'm the sixty-nine percent."
AMIR: Wrong note then.
JAKE: Yeah! Yeah it is, I can't believe you thought this said fine.
AMIR: Wrong note I said!
JAKE (At the same time Amir is speaking): There's so many words. You thought it said fine? You thought there was a chance-
AMIR (At the same time Jake is speaking): You already embarrassed me. You already ashamed me.
AMIR: Raise your hand if you think I have social issues!
JAKE: You know, can you really not just sit still?
JAKE: I told the officers you had a personality disorder, and they almost let us go but then you stole a billy club and hit a policeman in the shin with it. You said "Score one for the Hurwitz brothers! If you don't like our power, take it from us with brute force." That's when we were both tased.
AMIR: Why are you rehashing this shit? Alright, I was there.
JAKE: I know you were there.
AMIR: So you don't have to repeat it okay, just move on!
JAKE: Ok, fine, I'm-
AMIR: MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON! (People on the bus start to chant) MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON!
JAKE: HOW CAN YOU START CHANTS THIS EASILY?
