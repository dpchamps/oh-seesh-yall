INTRO:

AMIR: Hi.

JAKE: And?

AMIR: You are watching., so.

JAKE: Anything else?

AMIR: (quickly) You'rewatchingJakeandAmir!



[Jake is sitting at his desk. He turns around in his chair to see Amir wearing nothing but a speedo, carrying a rolled up yoga mat.]

JAKE: Wow...

AMIR: (smiling) I know, right? Aaah! (Amir's signature aaah!)

JAKE: No, you obviously don't if you're the one wearing that.

AMIR: [I'm] Doing yoga, so.

JAKE: [It] Doesn't explain... (winces) this (gestures at Amir's outfit).

AMIR: Yeah. It's the hot yoga, so. Bikram.

JAKE: Still, I can't imagine that's appropriate attire for yoga, or.. work, especially.

AMIR: Yeah, well I didn't wanna change at work, ok, cuz it's gross here.

JAKE: You walked to work in that?

AMIR: No, I didn't (imitating Jake's tone) walk to work in that. I took the bus!

JAKE: Ugh, you're not wearing any shoes!

AMIR: And?

JAKE: It's snowy outside?

AMIR: AND?

JAKE: ..That's it!

AMIR: So let me get this straight: you're jealous, of--

JAKE: Wow, no, you're already wrong. You know what, put on socks, put on shoes, put on pants, put on a shirt--

AMIR: Put on a break! Bihtin br--

JAKE: What? Huh?

AMIR: (same tone as his first interjection) Gimme a break!

JAKE: Gimme a break?

AMIR: Yeah--

JAKE: --Right--

AMIR: --Sorry, you weren't saying gimme shoes, gimme this, so--

JAKE: No I was saying put on.

AMIR: Yeah, so I made due. You know, when live gives you lemons, (falsetto) you make due!

JAKE: Okay, forget it, that's not the phrase.

AMIR: Okay, yes, forget it, because I'm late for yoga!

JAKE: Wow, so you haven't even been to yoga yet?

AMIR: (loudly and annoyedly) OH MY GOD, no, I haven't been to yoga yet; I don't even know where I can enroll!

JAKE: You're not enrolled in a yoga class?!

AMIR: NO, I'M NOT ENROLLED IN A YOGA CLASS! Okay, I'm sorry, last time I checked, I came into work, and you stopped me, huh? I didn't say anything. So let's just sit across from each other, keep are nose to the f***ing grindstone and not talk to each other for half a second, huh? Is THAT an option, DUDE?

JAKE: (exhales) ...Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.

AMIR: ehehg! I... was... MESSING WITH YOU, MAN! Hahahah, come on, let's hug it out over that one--

JAKE: No.

AMIR: Yeah, we're definitely hugging it out--

JAKE: No, we're definitely not--

AMIR: WE DEFINITELY ARE!

END.
