Jake (answering phone): Hello?

Amir: Woah. Wow. Hello.

Jake: What? Did you miss your flight?

Amir: Uh, yeah. Actually, no. I was... I'm in the bathroom now.

Jake: What?

Amir: Sorry, lavatory. I mean, what's the difference, anyway? There's nothing a little notorious about this place. 

Jake: What the hell are you talking about?

Amir: I mean, like, it looks like a bathroom, but they call it a lavatory. I just, I don't get it.

Jake: No, I mean how are you on the phone?

Amir: I don't know, I mean, I was lonely as hell, so I tried to see if this would work.

Jake: Come on, don't say lonely. Say bored, remember?

Amir: Ok, sorry. 

Jake: Alright, look, this is really dangerous, I'm just going to hang up. 

Amir: No, don't! I'm bored as shit! 

Jake: No, it's unsafe!

Amir: Ok, fine. I'll call you when I land.

Jake: Don't. Jesus.

Amir: Hello?

Rosie: Was that Amir?

Jake: Yeah. 

Rosie: Is he in-flight?

Jake: He is. 

Sarah: Um, Amir just texted me. 'What's Jake doing?'

Jake: Oh my god.
