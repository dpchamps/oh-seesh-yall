INTRO

JAKE: Hey, you're watching a really spooky episode of Jake and Amir?

AMIR: [panicked] Is it actually scary?



[Jake is on the couch. Amir sits down, wearing a literal big foot costume.]

AMIR: [sighs] Halloween time, and there is trouble afoot. [laughs]

JAKE: Awesome. "Bigfoot". Go with it.

AMIR: No, no. I wanted a bigger reaction. Let me give you some more options.

JAKE: No, no no no--



[Amir is dressed as a doctor in scrubs.]

AMIR: Fun thing about this costume: you can wear it after Halloween, and get into hospitals pretty easily.

JAKE: Why do you need to get into hospitals?

AMIR: For fun little pranks! Like two weeks ago, I walk up to a family of four in a waiting room who's [air quotes] "awaiting news", and I'm just covered in fake blood, and I go, "I'm... so sorry." They start bawling, I can't even keep a straight face! Funny thing is, three minutes later, the real doctor comes in and tells them that their little boy had indeed actually passed away. I felt... vindicated!



[Amir is wearing an illusion costume of a baby in a mother's backpack carrier.]

JAKE: ...Of course not.

AMIR: Wahhh!



[Amir is wearing another illusion costume, made to look like he is riding a turkey.]

AMIR: I think I'll quit candy next year... cold turkey! [chuckles]

JAKE: [feeling Amir's forehead] Yeah, your forehead is freezing. It's like a chilled glassy mug. How do you do that?

AMIR: Legally, I'm dead.

JAKE: I wish, man.

AMIR: Mean.



[Amir is dressed in a Ghostbusters costume.]

AMIR: I ain't afraid of no ghost!

JAKE: You absolutely are afraid of ghosts. You called me last night in tears because you were afraid a boogeyman was outside your window, trying to scare you.

AMIR: He was.

JAKE: You said he was staring at you from across the street, threatening you with cue cards, 'cause he didn't know how to speak?

AMIR: That's right.



[Amir is wearing a Maleficent gown costume.]

AMIR: Who's gonna refuse to give me candy?

JAKE: You go trick-or-treating? I thought this was for a costume party.

AMIR: What's a costume part?



[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume, and Jake is continuing the story.]

JAKE: The boogeyman's cue card said "I can see you, you spendthrift, you Jew spendthrift. Now come down here and give me cash or I'll boogie you."

AMIR: That's correct.

JAKE: You also mentioned the other side of his sign said "Why lie? I need pot", so I think you might have just gotten swindled by a homeless man.

AMIR: Perhaps, maybe. Mayhaps, probably.

JAKE: Probably.



[Amir is dressed in a German costume with lederhosen. The liquid in his beer stein is a shade of yellow completely unlike beer.]

AMIR: [in a German accent] You Americans have Halloween, we call it Oktoberfest. Prost!

JAKE: Did you piss in that?

AMIR: Ja, ja, I had to make it a bit yellow. [dips his finger in and sniffs it]



[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume. Jake continues.]

JAKE: When you finally approached the boogeyman with twenty-five hundred dollars in cash, he said "This  isn't enough. Get ready, I'm gonna boogie you." [Amir flinches.] So you ran away to the nearest ATM, and took out even more money.

AMIR: Yeah, the boogeyman's appetite for cash was insatiable, to be sure. But, I stood up for myself. I refused to be boogied.

JAKE: [waving his hands at Amir] Boogie-boogie-boogie-boogie!

AMIR: [raising his hands in self-defense and throwing cash at Jake] Aaah! Take my cash!



[Amir is dressed as Leonidas.]

JAKE: Dumb costume.

AMIR: [scoffs] Madness?

JAKE: I didn't say "madness".

AMIR: [standing up, preparing to kick Jake] This is Sparta!



[Amir is dressed as a prisoner. He seems to have lost all energy.]

AMIR: Jake, I'm exhausted... I'm tired of this.

JAKE: Me too.

AMIR: It's year in, year out, and it wears on you.

JAKE: It really does, every day.

AMIR: It's fatigue.

JAKE: It is.

AMIR: That's what it is. I feel... drained.



[Amir is in the Leonidas costume, and Jake is reeling from a kick in the chest.]

JAKE: Ohhh, you can't just go around kicking people in the chest, man! God, that's a dated costume!

AMIR: Dated?

[Amir stands up again.]

JAKE: Alright, stop. Hey.

AMIR: [preparing to kick Jake again] This is Sparta!

JAKE: Don't, don't--



[Amir, in the prisoner costume, continues his lament.]

AMIR: Look at me.

JAKE: I know. I'm telling you, this is self-reflection right now. It really feels like it's... it feels healthy--

AMIR: [suddenly energetic again] I'm doing a character! You idiot! [laughs] Gay prisoner!



[Amir is wearing an inflatable military costume.]

AMIR: Sergeant [bleep] reporting for duty, sir, in the Puffy Army.

JAKE: How is this even a costume? And can you please not say [bleep] in the office?

AMIR: I don't have to listen to you, [bleep]. I report to Colonel [bleep]. In the Puffy Army... [bleep] Division.



[Amir is wearing a bull rider illusion costume.]

AMIR: [doing a Southern accent] Oh hey, partner! Don't mind me, I'm just fuckin' a cow!

JAKE: You mean riding a bull.

AMIR: Oh... never mind.

JAKE: You thought this was a "fucking a cow" costume?

AMIR: Never mind!

JAKE: And when you said you spent a month at bull-riding camp, were you fucking cows?

AMIR: Never mind!
