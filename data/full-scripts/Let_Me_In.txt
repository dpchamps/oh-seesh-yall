INTRO

Amir: Yo, I don't need a script.

Amir rips his script.

Amir: You're watching...uh, sheesh.

Jake: Okay, you did.



Jake is sitting in an office doing work on his computer. Amir walks up to the door and tries to pull it open only to discover it's locked. Amir talks to Jake through the door.

Amir: Hey.

Amir knocks twice.

Amir: Hey comprende, ah, door's locked. You accidentally locked the door.

Jake: Yeah, I'm trying to do some work on my own, so...

Amir: Ah, okay. Um, unlock it for a second.

Jake: Look I'm really behind on some stuff and I just want to get it done without you distracting me. I'm sorry.

Amir: Aight, cool, peace.

Jake: Peace.

Amir knocks three times.

Amir: Ah, unlock the door-

Jake: You're still pulling-

Amir: for one second and then I can come inside.

Jake: You're still pulling on the door.

Amir: Just unlock it for one second, and then I'll open the door, and then I'll come inside.

Jake: Okay, I don't want you to come inside.

Amir scoffs.

Amir: I mean once I'm in there we can relock the door.  I mean, in fact I'd insist on it because there's like a lot of annoying people out here and I don't want us to get distractoid.

Jake: Okay, how's this? I'll just come outside when I'm done. Okay?

Amir:Latah.

Jake: Latah.

Amir: Peace.

Jake: Peace.

Amir rattles the door a little.

Amir: Latah.

Jake: Did you leave?

Amir: Yeah.

Jake: Then how can you hear me? And how come I can still see you?

Amir: Oh my god! Hey.

Amir knocks three times.

Amir: Can you, uh, unlock the door for a second? I have to go pee.

Jake: That sounds like a great reason not to come in this room.

Amir laughs.

Amir: Yeah. Good call.

Jake: Good call.

Amir: Hey open the door. I wanna high five you on that good call.

Amir puts his hand up and high fives the glass wall.

Jake: Air-five, right there.

Amir: Nah, nah, nah. It has to be the rea- the real thing.

Jake: Alright, peace.

Amir pulls on the door again.

Amir: Peace. Peace I'm out.

Jake: Later.

Amir: Later tron two-thousand and four, yo.- 

Jake: Alright.

Amir: -This is beat.

Amir laughs.

Jake: Peace out robot.

Amir: Okay, bye.

Jake: Bye.

Amir walks away, but runs back at the door, ramming into it with his body. Jake gets up. Amir ends up laying on the ground by the door with his glasses looking disheveled. Amir knocks on the door three times with his head. 

Amir: Hey dude, uh, me again. I think I left something in there. Can you open the door for a second.

Jake opens the door.

Amir: Wassup?

Jake: What's up?

Amir: I fell.

Jake: You fell.

Amir: Down.

Jake: Okay. Do you want to come in? You can come in if you want.

Amir: Thank you so mu-

Amir tries sitting up, but is in too much pain and has to lie down again.

Amir: Ow! Actually,ah, hey, I think I'm gonna, you need your space, right? So I'm gonna chill out here.

Jake: Okay, fine.

Amir: Yeah. We'll talk soon.

Jake gets up and let's the door close. As the door is closing Amir has a change of heart.

Amir: Actually, you know you could probably carry me in.

The door closes more.

Amir: Hey, J-j-j-j-j-, wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wai-
