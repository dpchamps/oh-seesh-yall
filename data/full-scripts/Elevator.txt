JAKE: Twelfth floor? 

GUY: Yeah.  

AMIR: Whoa! (chuckles) That was super scary. What happened? 

JAKE: Don't-- 

AMIR: (sigh) Whoa-oh!

JAKE: Oh my god.   

INTERCOM: Hi, is everything OK? 

AMIR: We're fine!

JAKE: We're not!

AMIR: Just go back to sleep, please. 

JAKE: He's not going to go- This is his job, he doesn't sleep. 

AMIR: Why are you trying to embarrass me? 

JAKE: He can hear me through your hand . . . We're stuck in the elevator-- 

AMIR: No, we're not! 



AMIR: You know it wouldn't surprise me if we were in here for the next three weeks.  

JAKE: That would surprise me a lot, actually.

AMIR: We should play a car game to pass the time. Let's look for out of state license plates. . . . ow. 



AMIR: Is your G-chat going slow? Mine's not working.

JAKE: What are you talking about?  

AMIR: You said that earlier today. 



AMIR: God, this is like that guy who was stuck in the elevator for 40 hours, only hopefully longer . . . what are you looking at? 



AMIR: Guys, we should all get tattoos of this experience so we don't forget it, I'll get the elevator, you get this homo.  

JAKE: (whispers) Oh, dude, come on. 

AMIR: Rations!

GUY: It-It's empty.  

AMIR: (scoffs) I was hungry. Sorry. Somebody's not getting to lick the bag. 

JAKE: What are you doing?! 

AMIR: I have to go! It's been like, forever!

JAKE: It's been three minutes. 

AMIR: It's just starting to dawn on me that we might not make it out of here alive.

JAKE: (whispers) Shut up. 

AMIR: We should all call our loved ones and say good-bye. (calls Jake)

JAKE: (sighs) Yeah.

AMIR: Pick it up! 

THE END.
