Josh: Uh, it's a 28 to 134.

Amir (interrupting): What's your favorite color, man?

Josh: Uh..

Amir: It's a two part question. What sort of standards did it come in lens, and then, what's your favorite color, man? So, like mine's blue and then yours would be red?

Josh: Why don't I take your picture against the plant there, man?

Amir (speaking over Josh): Definitely.

Josh: 1.. 2.. 3

Jake: OW! God! What is wrong with you? Am I bleeding?
