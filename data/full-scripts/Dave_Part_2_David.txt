INTRO Amir - Hey! You're watching Jake and Amir and David. Woo! I'm feeling good!

David - Classic.



(Amir and Jake are at their desks)

AMIR: Have you noticed Sarah and Dave have been at lunch for like, four hours already?

JAKE: Yes. Yes. Yes. 

AMIR: Isn't that longer than a usual lunch? Because you usually don't take lu--

JAKE: Shut up.

(Sarah and David enter. David is giving her a piggy-back ride and lies her down on Jake's desk then turns to lean over her) 

JAKE: Oh. 

DAVID: (to Sarah) Hey, you.

SARAH: Hi.

DAVID: I like your bangs.

SARAH: I like you.

(David motions for Jake to wiggle his fingers with him) 

JAKE: No. OK, no. I like working. You know, why don't you take this somewhere else? 

DAVID: Didn't see you there, Jake. 

(Sarah gets off Jake's desk to go back to her own)

AMIR: (chuckles) Hey, Dave. Nose candy tomorrow at lunch?

DAVID: You know it!

JAKE: What's that? What's nose candy?

AMIR: Me and Dave snort sugar at lunch and it makes us happy for a little time and then we sort of flatten out and get a little depressed. 

JAKE: Sugar?

DAVID: It's cocaine, dad. Relax.

JAKE: You guys do cocaine during work?!

AMIR: What's cocaine?

DAVID: (chuckles) How do you not love this guy?

JAKE: No, you're taking advantage of him, man!

DAVID: All right, he's a grown man, man. He can make his own decisions.

JAKE: Really?  Grown man? Look at him right now!

(Amir is leaned back in his chair, 'sleeping', with a cowboy hat on his face and the Amir and Jake puppets in his lap)

AMIR: (muffled) I don't want to hug you, grandma. 

DAVID: Jake, I thought we were getting along.

JAKE: Yeah, I thought so too, David.

DAVID: Hey. Call me Dave, my friends call me Dave.

JAKE: I was making a point. 

DAVID: Fine! (David leaves to go back to his desk)

(Jake stands up)

JAKE: And I know that you don't have a motorcycle!

DAVID: Yeah, I do. 

JAKE: Do you?

SARAH: Yeah, we went for a ride on it earlier. 

JAKE: OK. Went out on a limb there. Didn't really pan out. Sorry about that. Cool. Like a Harley or--?

DAVID: Yeah, Harley. (David sits at his desk) 

JAKE: Davidson, that's nasty. That is cool, man. Umm, sweet, sweet, sweet. (calling after David) Still shouldn't do drugs though! That's messed up. Umm, tell you what. We'll flip a coin right now, heads - you guys keep up doing your stupid little nose candy stuff, tails - you never do drugs again. 

(flips the coin and it falls on the floor, Jake bends over to grab it and smacks his head against his desk)

JAKE: (dazed) AH! Ah! Ah!  Umm, OK, it's on, I think it was on heads but it flipped . . . I-I-I will uh, which one was which again? 

THE END.
