INTRO

JAKE: Hey, you're watching a very clean episode of Jake and Amir!

AMIR: Fuck yeah!

JAKE: Nice.



[Jake and Amir are in a laundry room.]

JAKE: Alright, you're gonna learn how to do your laundry.

AMIR: Washing is fine. It's drying that's trying!

JAKE: You're wearing sopping wet pants that smell like vinegar. I don't think you're good at either.

AMIR: A clothesline? That takes time!

JAKE: Focus.

AMIR: I am!

JAKE: Not on rhyming.

AMIR: Okay.



JAKE: Alright, first thing's first. You want to separate your darks from your lights.

AMIR: Wow, racist much.

JAKE: [pulling a flag out of the basket] You have a Confederate flag in your laundry.

AMIR: [grabbing the flag] Coward!

JAKE: You are one.

AMIR: You are one!

JAKE: You are one!



[Amir is taking off his clothes.]

JAKE: These clothes stay on. These ones stay on!

AMIR: These ones are the dirtiest!



AMIR: [holding a pair of women's underwear in front of Jake] Oh, how embarrassing! A woman's underwear. I wonder how that got in there-- oh, maybe it was from a one-night stand I had with a 10!

JAKE: [grabbing the underwear] You know what? This is embarrassing, 'cause I saw you open a new package of women's underwear, smell them, crumple them up, and put them in the bottom of the bag. You fake-dropped them on the floor in front of me twice, hoping I would notice, then you finally just dangled them in front of my face and said "how embarrassing". You are a loser.

AMIR: In retrospect, she might have been a 9.

JAKE: Do you want to wash them or not?

AMIR: I do not. [grabs the underwear and smells it]



[Jake has begun the cycle. He and Amir stand in uncomfortable silence. Amir is naked.]

AMIR: How'd the hipster burn his mouth?

JAKE: I don't want to talk to you while you're naked.

AMIR: He drank coffee before it was cool!

JAKE: Nice.

AMIR: ...Do you mean that? The "nice" thing? I'm seriously asking for a friend.



[Amir bangs his head against the washer over and over again.]



AMIR: Some of these clothes are pee-proof, others, dry-clean only.

JAKE: None of your clothes are either, okay? It's just cotton clothing. You reek of piss.

AMIR: Eureka! [laughs] Sorry. It just sounded like you said "eu--"

JAKE: You smell like pee.

AMIR: I know.



AMIR: Tickle fight!

[Amir tickles Jake, who reflexively punches him in the face. Amir is out cold.]



[Amir pulls out his khakis, still with the stain on them.]

JAKE: Oh! Come on, I thought you washed those!

AMIR: I put them in the hamper! Though I feel like I can get one more wear out of these twats.

JAKE: Burn them.

AMIR: You'd love that, wouldn't ya. [holds the pants up to Jake's face]

JAKE: [recoiling] I would.



JAKE: [to an unconscious Amir] Hey... I was kidding, man! Come on. Get up, you... come on!

[Jake bends down and tickles Amir.]

JAKE: Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle...

[Amir giggles loudly.]



AMIR: [blowing soap suds at Jake] Come on! Ever been to a foam party?

JAKE: You know, you ruined all your clothes, you broke your washer, it's gonna cost you a lot of money.

AMIR: To get into the club? I don't think so! Not if I bring in tits and slits! Okay? It's called being a promoter.

JAKE: You can't talk without being bad.

AMIR: [dancing] Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz!



AMIR: Why is it that washing always costs more than drying?

JAKE: Washing takes more power, maybe? Water? To run the machine?

AMIR: Mmm, no. Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.

JAKE: Dick.

AMIR: What?

JAKE: Dick.

AMIR: Oh, okay. I thought you said something mean.



[Amir is still banging his head against the washer.]

JAKE: You're insane.



[Amir is having a party in the laundry room with two women. Dance music is playing.]

AMIR: [laughing] Yeah!

JAKE: How?

AMIR: Embrace it, dude! I'm a promoter!
