(from previous episode)

PAT: Stop! Sarah just texted me. 

AMIR: (covering Jake's ears) Oh no, don't let this guy hear!

PAT: She's throwing a party, and guess what? (taps Amir on the head) You're coming with me! 

(caption - THE NEXT MORNING...) 

(Inside Pat's apartment, there's a knock on the apartment door, Pat leaves his room, closing the door behind him, to answer the front door)

PAT: Ah! Hey, Jake! 

(Jake passes Pat and stands in front of the door to his room)

JAKE: Look. I have to know. Did sarah talk to any guys last night?

PAT: No, definitely not! Definitely not. 

(Sarah exits Pat's room, takes a few steps behind Jake and then turns around to go back into the room, door slams)

JAKE: Thank god. (sighs) You know it's- What was that? 

PAT: Ah! A windy breeze blew through the- It's an old apartment--

JAKE: That's fine. This whole Sarah thing is just really getting to me. 

PAT: Sarah thing? 

JAKE: Are you serious? You tried to cheer me up about it last night. 

PAT: Oh! 

JAKE: I'm stressed out because I'm in love with her. Oh my god. 

(Pat's door opens and Amir comes out wrapped in a towel)

PAT: Oh my god!!

(Sarah pulls amir back in) 

JAKE: I'm in love with her. 
AMIR: Jake was just talking mad smack about you, he was all like--

SARAH: Shut up! He can't know I'm here!

AMIR: What's the big deal? I crashed on the couch, you and Pat wrestled or whatever all night. IT WAS AWESOME!

SARAH: SHHH!

JAKE: What was that?

PAT: Uhh, it's the wind, it's this really breezy- I think the structures here--

JAKE: Shut up about the wind! Sorry. It's not you, it's just the thought of Sarah with another guy- (punches Pat's door) You know? (yells)

SARAH: Oh my god, this is awful. 

AMIR: Speak for yourself. (picks up a glass full of change) There's like $3,000 in here, do you know how much money I could buy with that? (begins pouring the coins slowly through the towel, as though hiding them away, they hit the hardwood, making a lot of noise) Shhh.

PAT: (trying to cover the noise) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get mad Jake! Scream! Ahh!

JAKE: Ahh!

PAT: Ahh!

JAKE: Ahh!

PAT: Ahh!

AMIR: AHH!! 

PAT: Keep screaming! 

JAKE: AHH! 

PAT: Scream! AHH!

JAKE: AHH! 

(noise stops)

PAT: How do you feel?

JAKE: Good. Good, that was good.  

PAT: Yeah.

JAKE: Let's chill in your room. (goes for Pat's door)

PAT: Wait! NO! 

THE END.
