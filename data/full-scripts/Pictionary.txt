PAT: Alright, Jake, you're ready?

JAKE: Yeah.

PAT: Okay, category is: movies.

Pat starts drawing.

JAKE: Okay.

AMIR: Apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple!

PAT: Stop! And you're not on my team!

AMIR: Don't fucking talk! That's rule number one, you dumb-ass Irish piece of shit!

JAKE: It's Indiana Jones.

PAT: Yes, yes, it is. Congratulations.

AMIR: Okay, great. My turn. 

Amir stands up and Pat sits down.

AMIR: Question n√∫mero uno: can I switch teams?

JEFF: Actually I think that...

JAKE: No! Too late. (to Pat) Hey, what's up?

AMIR: Jeff, how about don't fuck me on this for once?

JEFF: I'll try.

AMIR: The category is topics, and the topic is movies.

Amir starts drawing.

JEFF: Okay... umm...

JAKE: Just say movies.

JEFF: Lion King?

AMIR: (sighs) No joke... (covers mouth) sorry. No joke guesses though.

JEFF: I'm just gonna wait til he draws it all. Star Wars!

AMIR: Star... ?! You fucking see any star? I mean, I'm sorry I'm not supposed to say anything but... please, are you...? Jake, can you, tell him what it is.

JAKE: It's Freddy Got Fingered.

AMIR: Thank you!

JEFF: How would you get that?

AMIR: Same wavelength.

JAKE: No, it's the only movie he's ever seen.

AMIR: Also that.

PAT: How have you not seen any other movies?

AMIR: I mean, would, would Michelangelo draw anything after the Mona Lisa?

JAKE: Okay, number one: Da Vinci PAINTED the Mona Lisa, number two: he painted plenty of other things after 
that.

AMIR: Okay, number one: daddy would you like some sausage, number two: my bum is on the Swedish, number three: I keep on banging this marker against the board because Jeff is such an idiot that we have to get a new one. I'll be back (throws marker). Jake, you wanna come with me and get a new one?

JAKE: No.

Amir walks backwards and exits the room.

AMIR: I'll be back.

JEFF: Have you ever met his parents?

JAKE: God, no.

PAT: How are you good friends with him?

JAKE: It's complicated. Where is he by the way? It's been long. 

Jake stands up.

Jake and Pat find Amir on the hallway lying on the floor without a shirt.

JAKE: Wow.

PAT: Oh my God! Is he okay?

JAKE: Yeah, hes sleeping.

PAT: Hes drawn a picture.

Pat picks up papers from the floor.

JAKE: No, those are words. 

Jake grabs papers and starts reading.

JAKE: Jake, cnae find markers, got hot, thought I'd take a  snooze, wake me up pre Hercules on TNT, Amir.

PAT: How did you read that?

JAKE: I don't know.

PAT: There's more.

Jake switches page.

JAKE: Jake. LOL.
