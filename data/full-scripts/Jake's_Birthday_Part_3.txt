JAKE: It's Pat. He says everybody is at Cullen's. I'm going to go to Cullen's. 

AMIR: OK, wai-wai-wai-wai-wai-wait for me then. (at party) All right, listen, 5 minutes, and then we're peacing out of here, OK? We have laser tag reservations and my cousin, Leron, is expecting us.  

JAKE: OK, just relax.

AMIR: OK, I'm going to relax, just remember these people don't like us. 

(they go out to the porch)

EVERYONE: SURPRISE!!! (cheering) 

JAKE: (to Amir) Hey! Were you in on this? 

AMIR: No. I would never deceive you like that, OK? You call these people your friends? Honestly, honestly, honest-

JAKE: OK, stop. 

AMIR: Can I have a word with you in private, please? 

(Amir and Jake are now in the bathroom)

AMIR: All right, we need to talk in private. 

JAKE: This is- We're in the bathroom, OK? There's no more private space.

(Amir and Jake are now standing in the shower)

AMIR: Two hours ago, all these people were busy, right? Now they're all here having a party? Ooo...surprise surprise, right? 

JAKE: Exactly, surprise. 

AMIR: Yes, I- All right, this is a waste of time.

JAKE: Yeah.

AMIR: We should be discussing how the hell we're going to get out of this fucking hell-hole. 

JAKE: No, we should talking about how you're going to get the hell out of here, OK? All these people here that you hate? They're actually my friends, and they don't like you. 

AMIR: OK. Fine. You're right. Uhh, happy birthday. I'm going to go home. Or uh, to the dentist. I-I live-I live with a dentist, so I'm just going to go home. 

JAKE: (sighs) Just wait here for 30 seconds, OK? 

AMIR: Whoa, there's an Iceland?

(30 seconds later) 
(Amir walks out onto porch where everyone is)

EVERYONE: (far less enthusiastically) Surprise...whatever. 

AMIR: What?! But it's-wait- it's not even my birthday! 

JAKE: That's the surprise. 

AMIR: So everyone is here just for me?! 

JAKE: Yup. 

AMIR: So I can whatever, like, I want? 

JAKE: Well I made--

AMIR: All right, everybody, GET THE FU--

THE END.
