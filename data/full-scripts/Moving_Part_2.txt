Jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir—

Amir: Robert De Niro!

Jake: Are you trying to convince people he's here?

Amir: I don't know...



Amir: I can't believe we're moving in together.

Jake: Do you know what this move's about?

Amir: It's about.. the rest of our lives.

Jake: No, we're moving offices.

Amir: We're moving each other.

Jake: Technically, but just offices.



Amir: Oh my gosh, it's a draft of the first letter I ever wrote you.

Jake: I remember that. My second day here. It was pretty creepy.

Amir: Read it?



Amir: Remember when Grandpa built this place?

Jake: Don't force it.

Amir: (simultaneously) Force it.

Jake: Don't force it.

Amir: Yeah... I won't force it.



Jake: What up, bitch? I'm the class clown here.

Amir: Yeah...



Amir: Shhh... (pulls out gun)

Jake: Dude, no, no—

[Amir drops gun.]

Guy: AHH!

Jake: Oh—OH MY GOD!



Jake: What are some of your favorite words? Mine might match up. Your jeans fit you insanely well, and your attitude is ridiculously cool.

Amir: (simultaneously) Cool.

Jake: Yeah...



Amir: Whoa. I just realized something. If this office burns down, we won't have to move.

Jake: That's the opposite of true.

Amir: (snaps) Get the kerosene.

Jake: No, it's not true—

Amir: GET THE KERO—



Jake: You're just like the ocean under the moon. It's the same as the emotion that I get from—Yeah, you just, like, kinda transcribed Rob Thomas for a while there.

Amir: Yeah... The song was popular at the time.

Jake: It wasn't...



Amir: (wipes hands) I think I'm done! Packing-wise.

Jake: (holds up Jake puppet) This is the only thing you have in here.

Amir: ? It's my Jake in a box! ?

Jake: Just don't.



Amir: Oh my god, remember when we got this?

Jake: Those are Sarah's scissors; she bought them yesterday.

Amir: Okay, I'm gonna put 'em in my box, though.

Jake: Okay, no, Sarah! Sarah—

Amir: (makes noises over Jake) NARK!



Amir: You know what? Let's stay.

Jake: How do you think that's up to you?

Amir: Okay, you know what? Let's go. (picks up box to leave)

Jake: Still not up to you, but... (follows Amir)

[Shot of Jake and Amir's empty desks fades to black.]
