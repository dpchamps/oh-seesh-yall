(Amir is on stage with The Takeover UK.)

Amir: (singing) You'll fix everything by just being here-ah! (points at Jake; speaking) So. That one's called When You're Having a Bad 
Day.

Jake: I'm familiar with it.

Amir: You're familiar with it? That's it?

Jake: What do you want me to say? The band did great. You are very bad.

Amir: (satisfied) I was.

Jake: Did you hear what... Amir?

Amir: Yeah?

Jake: Did you hear what I said about your singing? It was very bad? I said it was bad.

Amir: As a band, where do you foresee us going (air quotes) from here?

(Josh starts drumming.)

Amir: ONE SECOND, Bradlin. Sorry.

Nic (Guitarist 1): Uh, his name's Josh.

Josh: Yeah, my name's Josh, I was gonna say that.

Amir: Okay, here's the problem. Usually, I'm rocking that thing, the guitar with the four strings.

Derek (Bassist): No you don't, man.

Jake: The bass.

Amir: The paste, yeah. Usually I'm on the paste, and it's just like—

Jake: I said the bass.

Amir: I said the bass.

Derek: You said paste.

Amir: One second, Bradlin. Sorry, but nobody's talking to you.

Derek: It's Derek.

Jake: You keep calling everyone Bradlin and it's not a name.

Amir: Yeah, I know, I know.

Jake: It's... weird.

Amir: Okay, okay, okay, eff him. You know what? ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR! (points at Jake)

(The band doesn't play.)

Amir: (frustrated grunt) Okay, band meeting, one second. (The band huddles together for a meeting.) All right, who here wants to get 
signed?

(Mark (Guitarist 2) raises his hand.)

Amir: So that's one.

Josh: We're already signed.

Amir: Great. (Turns back to Jake.) We are Jake and the Amirs!

Mark: Awesome!

Nic: Uh, we're called The Takeover UK?

Mark: Oh yeah, that's right. Still, I like this guy's leadership.

Amir: Thank you, Bradlin.

Mark: Oh, no, it's Mark.

Amir: Bradlin.

(Mark shrugs.)

Amir and Mark/Bradlin: ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!

(Mark starts playing, while the rest of the band leaves.)

Amir: (singing) If you're on a boat that you're paddling, horse that you're saddling, if you're on the stage then your name better be 
Bradlin—

(The whole band is playing, with Amir on the tambourine.)

Mark: (singing) Bradlin, B-B-Bra-adlin. Bradlin, B-B-Bra-adlin.

(The song ends.)

Amir: That was very bad. Let me do the singing from now on, ready? (clears throat) One, two, three—you're right.

Josh: One, two, three, four.

(The band starts playing.)

Amir: Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad Bra-ad...
