INTRO

JAKE: You're watching Jake and Amir!

AMIR: Hey, it's a living!

JAKE: Just don't talk.

AMIR: Deal!



[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks.]

AMIR: Oh, hey Jake.

JAKE: Yeah.

[Amir turns and smiles, revealing that he has braces.]

AMIR: Have a good one.

JAKE: Oh, no...

AMIR: Oh, yeah!

JAKE: Blood.

[Amir's gums have begun bleeding to the point where all of his teeth are red.]

AMIR: Oh... no. Oh no.

JAKE: At least tell me you went to a real orthodontist.

AMIR: I can tell ya... but then I'd have to kill ya!

JAKE: Why?

AMIR: It's... just a t-- forget it, okay? My cousin Leron jacked the pamphlet from a dentist and tried to slap these on herself.

JAKE: Herself?

AMIR: Himself, I said.

JAKE: No, you didn't.

AMIR: Turns out, he couldn't. Wuh-oh, no surprise there. Leron's a coward and a thief. Good thing his buddy Travin was right around the corner, and he fixed me up right good! Only problem is: he's concussed.

JAKE: How?

AMIR: Sittin' in the operating chair, I'm this terrible combination of pissed and scared, kickin' my legs willy-nilly like a jackrabbit over water, but Lee and Trav were gung-ho about the project, not ready to relent. Luckily for me, Trav [now pronounced trayv] is a frickin' geezer.

JAKE: How old is he?

AMIR: He's a sprightly ninety-three, but doesn't look a day under thirty.

JAKE: That's cuz he's not.

AMIR: Anyway, I kick him straight in the jar.

JAKE: Do you mean jaw?

AMIR: I wish!

JAKE: What was wrong with your teeth, anyway?

AMIR: Don't pretend you didn't notice, okay? Gingivitis, plaque, rotting-gum disease, oral acne, periodontic rosacea...

JAKE: So they weren't crooked, though.

AMIR: God, no. Nah, I had a--, like, headgear for the first eleven years on Earth.

JAKE: Right. Since you were an infant?

AMIR: Yeah. Well, even way before. I even had one of those chinstrap things and, like, a built-in retainer you had to turn with, like, a... like a-- that soda can opener thing?

JAKE: Like a tab?

AMIR: No, like the thing you open a soda can with.

JAKE: The tab.

AMIR: Yeah. Right, exactly. A tab. Either way, in about three weeks I'm gonna have the brightest set of pearly-whites you'll ever see!

JAKE: Braces straighten your teeth. They don't whiten them.

[Amir makes a face and bobbles his head, mocking Jake. Jake looks confused.]

AMIR: I know.

JAKE: You know?

AMIR: I know.

JAKE: You know. Okay, so why--

AMIR: I know! So drop it.

JAKE: So why would you--

AMIR: So drop it.

JAKE: Your gums are bleeding, man.

AMIR: Bleeding? ...Or am I just eating a red velvet cupcake?

JAKE: Bleeding.

AMIR: Incorrect! [He pulls out a red velvet cupcake.] Both.

JAKE: That looks like an intact cupcake, so you didn't eat it.

AMIR: I was gonna, okay? But my teeth frickin' kill.

JAKE: Wow, braces, fallin' off.

[Amir's braces have slipped off his teeth.]

AMIR: Yeah. Here we go...
