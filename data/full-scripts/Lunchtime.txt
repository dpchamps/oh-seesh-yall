Jake: What's up, man?

Amir: Hey. 

Jake: Eating by yourself like a fucking loser, huh?

Amir: Yeah.

Jake: You're a fucking joke, Blumenfeld, you know that?

Amir: Ok.

Jake: Have you even gotten laid? You ever fucked, Blumenfeld? No, I didn't think so, did you? You're a piece of shit, right? 

Jake: You think you're a piece of shit? Just say you're a piece of shit. 

Amir: Owwww. 

Jake: Say it.

Amir: I'm a piece of shit. 

Jake: Yeah.

Amir: Just leave me alone!

Jake: That's right. 

Amir: You know, you're not being very nice to me today.

Jake: Yeah, fuck you. 

Amir: I mean, I appreciate that you're sitting next to me, eating lunch with me, but-

Jake: Yeah right. I wouldn't eat lunch with you to save my mother's life. 

Jake: You know you're a fucking joke, man? Nobody respects you, why don't you name one person in this office that even likes you. 

Amir: I don't know, you?

Jake: Wrong!

Amir: Why don't you just get out of here and let me finish my lunch in peace?

Amir: Come on! Look, this is all wet! Ugh, it's so soggy! Ugh, it's gross! Ugh, so soggy! It's so gross! What's your problem?

Jake: Hey, Amir, one last thing. 

Amir: What?

Jake: You failed. That's right, man. It was a test. 

Amir: What are you talking about?

Jake: Can't let people talk to you like that, man. You gotta, you gotta stand up for yourself. Be strong.

Amir: Ok. Thanks.

Jake: Yeah.

Amir: Uh, if you ever do another test, can you make sure it's not this way?

Jake: Don't talk back to me!

Amir: I'm so sorry.

Jake: Alright, see ya.

Amir: It's meant a lot to me. 

Jake: Yeah, whatever.

Jake: I bet you I can go in there and barrade Amir, ruin his lunch, come back out, and he's gonna respect me more than he ever has. 

Jeff: Yeah, probably.

Jake: Yeah.
