PREVIOUSLY ON JAKE AND AMIR...:

AMIR: Remember how you told me to hire a dating coach to help me hit on girls better?

JAKE: (sighs) No.

BEN SCHWARTZ: (rolls in on chair and shakes hands with Amir) Amir Blumenfeld, how are you.



BEN SCHWARTZ: That's your girl, ok?

AMIR: Sure.



AMIR: I've.. been, I've-- we were.. toge-together--



JAKE: -n with, secondly, were are you guys gonna go to lunch? Because thirdly, (slaps Amir on his shoulder) we're coming with.



INTRO:

DEEP DRAMATIC VOICE (SAM REICH): You are watching Jake and-- (coughs)

AMIR: (clears throat) Amir. Whoa, that was weird.

JAKE: Yeah.



[Jake and Amir are standing outside Ricky's office, while Sarah and Hallie talk inside Ricky's office.]

AMIR: I think I shouldn't be wearing a shirt, remember?

JAKE: (sighs) I don't care, what you do, at all...

BEN SCHWARTZ: (rolls in on office chair) Why are you wearing a shirt? You shouldn't be wearing a shirt. You should be peacocking all over the place.

(Amir looks at Jake with disdain as he takes off his sweater.)

BEN SCHWARTZ: So this is what we're gonna do, we'll lead off-- concentrate, we'll lead off with a joke. (to Jake) Do you know any funny jokes?

JAKE: Guy walks into a bar, ouch.

BEN SCHWARTZ: (laughs like a seal loudly, making Jake and Amir cover their ears and Sara and Hallie look at him strangely) HAHEAH! UEH UHUHUH! UUUEH!--

AMIR: Ah! What's that?

BEN SCHWARTZ: That's the way I laugh. Not a big deal. When you get in there, you guys are gonna be like Raisin Bran over my aunt's ***s, ok?

AMIR: I don't get that! Whenev--

BEN SCHWARTZ: Let's get in there and let's do it. Let's get in there and do that. (to Jake) We'll get you a dick, let's do it.

JAKE: (to Ben Schwartz) Hey!

(The three guys walk into Ricky's office.)

AMIR: Ladies.

SARAH: Amir, Jake. A word. (She gets up and leads them out of Ricky's office, shoving Amir.)

BEN SCHWARTZ: (to Hallie) Is that seat taken?

HALLIE: Um, kind of, yeah.

BEN SCHWARTZ: Yeah, by me, probably.

[Sarah is talking to Jake and Amir outside Ricky's office.]

SARAH: You guys, seriously, how many times do I have to tell you not to talk to my sister? (to Jake) YOU had your chance; (to Amir) You left her in the middle of a park during your date!

AMIR: (unbuttoning his shirt) Yeah, that was a weird thing.

SARAH: What are you doing?!

AMIR: Peacocking! One second!

SARAH: Just leave that on, you guys are both disgusting, god. (walks back into Ricky's office.)

[Ben Schwartz is trying to seduce Hallie, leaning towards her and talking while she leans away.]

BEN SCHWARTZ: --let you be the princess of my--

AMIR: (to Ben Schwartz) Whoa! Amir. A word.

[Amir and Ben Schwartz are talking outside Ricky's office.]

AMIR: K, what the heck was that?

BEN SCHWARTZ: First of all, you gotta pay me that $150,000 when this is done, ok? The other thing is I'm setting you up.

[Jake, Sarah, and Hallie are sitting at the table in Ricky's office.]

JAKE: So...--

SARAH: Don't!

(Amir's voice can be heard from outside the room: --you being nice to her, and you just told me not to be--)

JAKE: ...It's nice to see you. That's it.

[Back to outside Ricky's office.]

BEN SCHWARTZ: No, I was trying to be your fern to a s- a salad sandwich, you know what I mean?

AMIR: Always, with the things I don't get, I don't know metaphors...

BEN SCHWARTZ: Ok, fine, then what do you like?

AMIR: Chicken nuggets, P.O.D., Freddy Got Fingered,--

BEN SCHWARTZ: Ok good, it was like P.O.D. was eating chicken nuggets--

(Amir immediately laughs, and Ben Schwartz joins in with his seal laugh.)

BEN SCHWARTZ: Yeah, yeah, you got it?

[Amir and Ben Schwartz are entering Ricky's office, by foot and rolling chair, respectively.]

BEN SCHWARTZ: Jake, Sarah? A word?

(Jake and Sarah reluctantly get up and leave.)

[Amir is talking to Hallie inside Ricky's office, while Jake, Sarah, and Ben Schwartz listen and watch through the glass walls from outside.]

AMIR: Hi, Hallie, hmhm (awkward laugh) Uh, everyone-- (the camera reveals that Amir is not wearing a shirt) --sorry, everyone is asking me to be one way, or.. another, and, I'm just-- I can't do that anymore, I just have to be honest with you.

HALLIE: That's great, Amir.

AMIR: I think you're a stupid ugly bitch, and I hate your shoes. (clenches his face and crosses his fingers in suspense, while Hallie looks away slowly)

(Ben Schwartz crosses his fingers and gives a thumbs up from outside the room. Sarah grabs Amir's shirt that was on her head and tosses it aside.)

AMIR: So do you wanna... What do you wanna do, do you wanna go on a date, or hug me, or.. how does that work out?

(Hallie gets up and leaves.)

AMIR: Some alone time. Totally cool. I need my space too.

END.
