[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir has a hanger sticking out the back of his shirt. Jake's wrist is in a brace.]

AMIR: Hey.

JAKE: ...

AMIR: Hello?

JAKE: Hey.

AMIR: It's me.

JAKE: I know, you're-- you're sitting across from me.

AMIR: What's going on for tonight?

JAKE: Nothing.

AMIR: You know I can barely hear you, I dunno if it's you or if it's me.

JAKE: It's definitely you. We're not on the phone, Amir.

AMIR: Ok. Lemme talk to you later.

JAKE: That's fine.

AMIR: Alright I'll talk to you later.

JAKE: Ok!

AMIR: Bye.

JAKE: What is your problem, and what is in your back?

AMIR: What? (reaches his arm to feel for what's in his back. He grabs it and starts laughing.) Oh my God. Look at this! I walked to work, (he takes out the hanger) there's still a hanger in my back. Ahah! I guess I never took it off of it when I wore it to work.

JAKE: C'mon, man.

AMIR: What?

JAKE: We talked about this. I will only talk to you if--

AMIR: If you don't feel pity, I know, I'm sorry.

JAKE: ...

AMIR: Jake, it's Amir. I feel really bad about before. I hope we can still be gullies, man.

JAKE: ...

AMIR: (scratching his neck with the hangar) Uh... Jake it's Amir again--

JAKE: Shut up!

AMIR: Hello?

JAKE: ...
