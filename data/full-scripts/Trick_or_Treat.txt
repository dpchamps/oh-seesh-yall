JAKE: Do you need a script?

AMIR: Yes.

INT: CollegeHumor Office 

(Amir enters in Dorothy dress with fireman helmet on)

AMIR: Ugh! Long day (sits at desk) and it's just getting started.

JAKE: No. It's 5:30.

AMIR: Well, it's gotta be 5:30 somewhere.

JAKE: It is. Here.

AMIR: Just sendin' out my minions soon to do (said in Amir's classic nasal voice) the dirty work. (In his normal voice) Sendin' out my minions to do the-

AMIR AND JAKE: dirty work.

JAKE: Got it. I actually don't want you to explain anything else because I do not want to be involved in whatever you-

AMIR: 300 kids in 213 neighborhoods. All over the city. Plus! A little upstate New York. I even got one in Allentown, PA workin' for me! Dude's a little shit though. Met him on Facebook.

JAKE: How'd you meet the other ones?

AMIR: Facebook. But they all weren't little shits about it.

JAKE: Got it.

AMIR: Jake. These kids are bringin' home 2 pillow cases full of candy, min. I skim 10% off the top and pay them double face for each piece. (Laugh)

JAKE: So you're paying them?

AMIR: Oh, out of the nose man. I'm like Willy Wonka, baby. Chomp Chomp, bitch.

JAKE: Willy Wonka never said that. Why would you pay them for candy bars?

AMIR: Dude it's ridiculous. I ended up owing a kid over $800 last year for a frickin' York Peppermint Patty.  I don't know.

JAKE: How is that two times face?

AMIR: That one got away from me. I'll admit it. It was a slippery slope there, so.

JAKE: Okay, well you know that: A) You can buy your own candy at the store and B-

AMIR: All right. Stop right there! Okay, because I'm not doing this for the candy, all right.

JAKE: So why are you paying kids literally hundreds of dollars-

AMIR: Thousands of dollars.

JAKE: Thousands of dollars!

AMIR: Can you just shut up one second?! I'm on Facebook Chat with this little twerp from Allentown. Now he's telling me that I have to pay for my own train ticket out there. Okay, so, how do I get back? Do I ask his dad for a ride? Clearly not because his dad's already pissed at me for talking to the 13-year-old while he's at school.

JAKE: Why are you wearing a dress?

AMIR: Okay, all right, all right. How long have you been sitting on that question, Hurwitz? What else?

JAKE: I'm serious. It's Thursday, it's not Halloween. There's no Halloween-

AMIR: Laundry Day. Okay?

JAKE: So you had no other clean clothes?

AMIR: No! What? No! Laundry Day is when I steal shit from Laundromats. You think I bought this dress? No! I'm like Willy Freakin' Wonka.

JAKE: You don't know who Willy Wonka is.

AMIR: Chomp. Chomp.

JAKE: Who's washing a fireman's helmet?

AMIR: You gotta promise not to tell on me, man.
