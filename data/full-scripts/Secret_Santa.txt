INTRO

AMIR: Who has two thumbs and you're watching Jake and Amir?

JAKE: Not how that goes.

AMIR: Nooo.  



AMIR: (Checks laptop)  Oh no!  (Slams elbows on desk)

JAKE: What?

AMIR: Do you get this e-mail even?

JAKE: What e-mail?

AMIR: (interrupts and imitates Jake) What e-mail?  Look then if you don't know.  Don't ask me a question; be proactive, check it out—

JAKE: You asked me if I got the e-mail.  I said 'what e-mail?'.  What—

AMIR: Secret Santa e-mail, okay?

JAKE: That e-mail came in a week ago!

AMIR: Secret Santa, huh?  More like Secret Not.

JAKE: You gotta stop it with that Not joke, okay?  It never works.

AMIR: Oh this is the worst day of my life since last year's Secret Santa e-mail.

JAKE: Why is it so bad?

AMIR: Do you even know what Secret Santa is?

JAKE: We randomly choose a co-worker to give a gift to at the Christmas party?

AMIR: Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.

JAKE: I was done talking.

AMIR: (Gestures towards Jake) C-Can I?

JAKE: I was finished.

AMIR: What?

JAKE: Yes, go ahead.

AMIR: (Continues to gesture towards Jake and tilts head up) Can I talk?

JAKE: That's how a conversation works; I'm done talking!  You don't...What is...I don't even know...What happening right now?

AMIR: Give a gift: That's my problem right there; giving a gift.  You realize there are children starving in Africa right now, right?  And I'd rather punch them all in the face than have to give a shitty ass co-worker a shitty ass gift.

JAKE: So don't sign up.

AMIR: Don't sign up.  Ah haha!  That's great! Except for then I wouldn't get (slams fists on desk for emphasis) a gift!  I wouldn't get (slams fists on desk for emphasis) a gift And I  want (slams fists on desk for emphasis) a gift!  I just don't want to give (slams fists on desk for emphasis) one.

JAKE: You're a bad person.

AMIR: Whatever, Man, I'll just giftwrap a piece of garbage and give it to an employee, I don't care. (Begins to cry)

JAKE: You know you're crying?

AMIR: (Sarcasm) Wow.

JAKE: You're crying right now, okay?!  You realize you're almost 30 and you're crying?  You cry more than any—

AMIR: Almost 30! 

JAKE: You've come to say you cry more than any other adult I know.

AMIR: I know, I know.

JAKE: If you know then make a change!

AMIR: I'm starving!

JAKE: That's like a baby excuse for why they would cry.

AMIR: Thanks for calling me your baby.

JAKE: I didn't call you my baby.

MARINA: Alright, you guys gotta pick your name for Secret Santa.

AMIR: Jake.

Marina: Out of a hat.

AMIR: Jake out of a hat then.

JAKE: Just pick a name, Dude.

AMIR: (Picks name out of hat) Okay, giftwrap garbage for this guy if you don't let me choose again.

MARINA: Fine.

AMIR: (Pulls out/Puts back different names from hat) No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. (Pauses to look at name) No.  (Picks a new name) Oh.  Mmmkay.  

(Marina peaks at the name Amir has picked)

JAKE: Come on.

MARINA: Yeah, he didn't even get you.

AMIR: I can't even read the small writing, okay!?  Let me choose again or I'm gonna cry. (Begins to cry)

MARINA: You're already crying.

AMIR: Aw I'm his baby.  Gotta love me.
