INTRO

A: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I can dunk a basketball.

J: No one will believe that.

A: Well, they don't have to.

J: ...what?



[Jake is at work when he gets a Skype call. Disgruntled, he answers it.]

A: [singing  dancing] California girls, they're unforgettable; daisy dukes, bikinis on top -

J: [interrupting] How was your aunt's funeral?

A: Fine. 'Sup with you?

J: Not much man, I'm at work.

A: Enough about me; let's talk about you.

J: ...We were.

A: [in a high-pitched voice] Check your inbox!

J: [clicks his mouse] Wow, a plane ticket.

A: Can't wait to see you, bro. [lifts up fist to the camera as if to ask Jake to props him via Skype]

J: I'm not going anywhere. [puts his fist up to the camera, doing props with Amir]

A: Nowhere but up...ON A PLANE! [imitates a plane taking off and crashing with his hand]

J: Jesus Christ, this is a first-class ticket.

A: Only the best... [cups his hands around his mouth] for the best. [laughs]

J: You shouldn't have, and not in the polite way.

A: Fully 180-degree reclinable seats, four meals...

J: [incredulous] Four meals?!

A: Yeah, one per layover.

J: Wow, yeah; you have me flying through Singapore.

A: [making a stereotypical impersonation of an Asian person] Oh!! Taseito!! Hee hee hee!! [puts up the peace sign]

J: Aren't you in Queens? 'Cause I could take the subway.

A: Subways do NOT have in-flight HD TV, bro.

J: They don't have in-flight anything.

A: That's the Lustanza difference. [winks]

J: How did you think I was going to get TO the airport? 

A: Subway. Okay, I'm not paying for your cab; I'm already $2250 down in the hole. And that's cash I DON'T have. 

[knock on the Amir's door]

A: Can you hold on a second? 

[Amir leaves the camera so we only hear his voice and Jake's reactions]

A: What do you want, Mom?...Okay, I don't wanna SAY goodbye to Aunt Harold! She has a mustache! [higher pitch] Get OFF of me!! YOU'RE HURTING MEEEEE!!

[Jake hears a slapping noise, winces]

A: ...Ow! 

[Amir sits back down, holding his cheek] 

A: Hey dude, can I actually call you back?

J: We can definitely get off the phone; you don't have to worry about calling me back.

A: All right, bye. [tries to end the call, but fails] Arrrrrgghhh...uuuuuurrrrgggghhh, son of a bleach!! This frickin' krills!!! Uuuuurrrrggghhhh...gosh darnit [incoherent moans]

J: [watching uncomfortably] Dude, you have to hang up. You have to hang up; press the X.

A: [looks at the camera] ...What are you still doing here? Your flight's in 20 minutes. And take the subway!!
