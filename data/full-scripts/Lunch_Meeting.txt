(Jake and Amir are in a conference room. Amir runs out, and returns an indefinite amount of time later, still putting on a shirt 
identical to Jake's.)

Jake: So you left to get the same shirt as me?

Amir: Can't prove that. Let's eat.

Jake: Can we just try to get some work done before we do that, please?

Amir: Can I just eat before we get some work done? Because I'll be more productive if I have food in me.

Jake: You probably won't be, but fine. Not gonna argue.

Amir: (Using the phone) I'm gonna order something.

Jake: Okay.

Amir: (Talking into the phone) 911? Yes—

(Jake slams on the phone's switchook)

Jake: Jesus Christ, man!

Amir: What? You don't know how hungry I am! It's a fucking emergency dude.

Jake: Jus—it's not an emergency, just call Domino's.

Amir: I'm hungry as shit.

Jake: Don't care.

Amir: I'll do it the old fashioned way though, for you. (Talking into the phone) Bonjour, Domino's.

Jake: Pizza's Italian.

Amir: Uh, yes. Can I have 30 large cheese fromage pizzas—

Jake: That's too many.

Amir: Okay. 30 medium pizzas then.

Jake: But that's still 30. Amir.

Amir: (To Jake) I'll take the rest for dinner. Don't worry about it. (To Domino's) Uh, yes. That's fine. Uh, charge it to my credit 
card. The number... yes.

Jake: Okay then just hang up.

Amir: The number...

Jake: Hang up the phone.

Amir: The number of my credit card is 8.

(Jake hits the switchook)

Jake: Come on.

Amir: What if he believed it?

Jake: It wouldn't have been good if he believed it. I'm calling a deli. (Talking into the phone) Hi. Uh, can I have a turkey club? Uh, 
and...

Amir: 30 medium pizzas.

Jake: (To Amir) Instead of that.

Amir: Jam.

Jake: What kind of bread?

Amir: No bread.

Jake: That's disgusting, I'm not saying that. You say it.

Amir: Just... (takes the phone) Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry. Uh, can I have jam? Tuna fish, cracked pepper, and vinegar, on a chocolate 
croissant.

Jake: Oh my god, that's dis...

Amir: And, to drink... just... (To Jake) Do you want anything?

Jake: (Shaking his head) I lost my appetite.

Amir: (To the phone) Uh, just a keg of what Coke is made out of.

Jake: Syrup?

Amir: Just the syrup, yeah. Uh, yeah that should be fine. Oh! Um, and, do you guys... you know how turkey pastrami is like, turkey with 
a pastrami seasoning around it? Do you have that, but with Twinkies? With the seasoning? No. Okay. So that was just a dream of mine, 
then. That's fine, I was just checking.
