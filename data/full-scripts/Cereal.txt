Jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!

Amir: Nice mustache!

Jake: I don't have a mustache....

Amir: They don't know that!



[Amir is on his computer at his desk, Jake is walking to his desk with a bowl of cereal]

Amir: [Getting up] Oh! Here we go! [Runs up to Jake]

Jake: Whoa! Hey! Hey! No!

[Amir kicks the cereal out of Jake's hands, sending it flying all over 
Jake and the Golden Tee machine]

Amir: Boom, baby!

Jake: Why?

Amir: [Yelling] Whoo!

Jake: 'Whoo!' what?

Amir: The uhh.... my kick. Hey, can I actually ask you a super personal question....

Jake: No! You can't!

Amir: OK, you've been acting like a real bitch ever since that kick, did I say something to you? Or do something?

Jake: You did something to me! You kicked cereal into my face!

Sarah: Jake, come on, you know the saying, there's no use crying over spilled milk!

Amir: That's not a phrase, OK? Nobody's talking to you!

Jake: She's defending you! And that is the phrase! I can't believe this, this is insane! I have to go home now! [Puts on sunglasses] I have to go home and shower! [Starts walking away].

Amir: Jake, wait! [Jake turns around] OK your sunglasses look ridiculous and stupid! They look really dumb!

Jake: OK, well it doesn't matter 'cause I'm just gonna go....

Amir: [Singing] Na na naaa na..... na na naaa na.....

All except Jake: [Joining Amir] Hey hey hey! Good bye!

[Jake walks out embarrassed]

Amir: [Lauging] Haha, Mondays!

Sarah: It's Tuesday....

Amir: Whatever.
