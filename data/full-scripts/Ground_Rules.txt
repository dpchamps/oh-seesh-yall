Jake: No.

Amir: Sure thing.

Jake: I didn't say that. You said that.

Amir: Alright Jakie, now that you're back, let's go over some quick ground rules.

Jake: Okay.

Amir: Alright, rule the first, you do what I tell you to, when I tell you to do it, why I tell you to... do it.

Jake: Of course.

Amir: Okay... Rule number two, you eat healthy food for me, so that I can continue eating garbage, junk food...

Jake: I guess I'm at least happy that you know that you don't eat healthy.

Amir: Thank you, but you're not going to get out of this that easily. Rule tree, err, rule three. Sorry, I said tree instead of three. I meant to say three.

Jake: Just say whatever you're going to say.

Amir: Okay, rule four.

Jake: So no three?

Amir: You show up at seven AM to do my work before even beginning your work.

Jake: What is your work?

Amir: It's not my problem anymore. That's my work.

Jake: You have no idea what you do. Anyway, bad news boss.

Amir: What is it non-boss?

Jake: I'm afraid today is opposite day.

Amir: Impossible.

Jake: Or is it entirely possible?
