INTRO

AMIR: Hey, you're watching a real [drawn-out yell] goal! --episode of Jake and Amir!

JAKE: Bye.

AMIR: Wait!



[Pat, Jake, Paul, and Rachel are on a couch, watching the World Cup. Amir comes in and wiggles himself in between Jake and Paul, where there is clearly no room.]

AMIR: It's fun to watch TV at work! Thanks for including me, guys!

[Amir's presence on the couch forces Pat off onto an adjacent chair. Amir puts his arm around Jake.]

JAKE: We specifically tried not to include you. The email went out to a special Listserv we created, called "allbutamir@collegehumor.com".

AMIR: Can I change the channel? Can I change the channel, or do we have to watch this soccer shit?

[Jake pushes Amir's hand off of him.]



AMIR: [on the phone] Hi, twat. Yeah, can we get two large pizzas, one medium pie, and, let's say, seven small 'zas?

PAUL: Those are all just different words for the same thing.

RACHEL: And we already have pizza.

AMIR: And chicken wings? Yeah, I love those frickin' things.

JAKE: Can you not order in weird rhymes? It's rude.

AMIR: Whats?

JAKE: ..."Whats"?



AMIR: Ever notice how we call it "soccer", but in the rest of the world it's all like "Futbol! Futbol! Futbol!"

[Paul smiles.]

JAKE: Of course we noticed that.

AMIR: Then laugh! It's an observational humor!

JAKE: It's not humor. It's just an observation.

AMIR: Still! A chuckle would have been decent. Got this fatass to grin about it! [laughs]

PAUL: Oh, no. My cousin just sent me a text that made me smile. It wasn't you.

AMIR: [still laughing] Count it!



AMIR: [on the phone] My credit card number is, um, uh... [laughing] it's sixty-nine.

JAKE: Give me the phone.

AMIR: Alright. [hands Jake the phone]

JAKE: [on the phone] Four two two...

AMIR: Aww.



AMIR: Ahhh, this sport is boring. Nothing ever happens. It's just like, pass the ball. Kick the ball. I don't--

[Everybody stands up, cheering and clapping.]

ALL: Goal! / Yes! Oh, man!

AMIR: And the universe gives me a slice of humble pie! My point still stands, though: Hardly anything ever--

ALL: Another goal! / Another one, oh my God! / Whoa!



[Amir is eating the food he had ordered. Pat reaches for something, but Amir slaps his hand away.]

AMIR: In what fucking world do you live in?

PAT: Are... are you serious?

AMIR: Yeah, I'm serious. This is my food, shitbird.

PAT: You ate all our pizza.

AMIR: I'm not talking to you.

JAKE: You are talking to him. By the way, I paid for this food. Okay? Remember, your card number was sixty-nine.

AMIR: As a joke! 'Cause sixty-nine means to [Amir is censored by a bleep and a black bar over his mouth. Amir makes a variety of hand gestures to convey his point. Jake cringes. Rachel leaves in disgust.]

JAKE: No, it does not!



AMIR: Everybody in this sport has a weird name. Who's that guy? Garageio?

PAUL: That's Fred.

AMIR: Weird.

PAT: Your name's Amir!

AMIR: Take that back!



PAUL: Hey, man. Maybe you could apologize to Rachel. 'Cause--

AMIR: Why? I didn't do anything bad. All I said was that sixty-nining was, like, a [Amir is censored again.]

JAKE: --Stop it!

RACHEL: [crying off-screen] Make him stop!



AMIR: Why is it when people take up soccer it's considered cute and quirky, but when I get a hobby, no one says jack shit?

JAKE: Your hobbies aren't important. They don't affect anyone or anything.

PAT: No-- what are your hobbies?

AMIR: Well, not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, I'll always pretend like it's buzzing. Make my dumbass mom or my goofy dad walk up to the waitress, time after time, in vain. [chuckles] Then at the end of the bit, I'll throw the beeper away so that my dad ends up owing cash for it.

JAKE: Your hobbies are bad.

AMIR: No shit, dude.

JAKE: You're bad.



AMIR: All I'm saying is that real athletes don't wear cleats. They wear real shit, like baseball shoes.

JAKE: Baseball players wear cleats.

AMIR: ...I'm starting to think my only friend in the room [gesturing at Paul] is Fatass over here. [to Paul] What do you think, dummy? [doing a voice for Paul, like a ventriloquist] "Who are you calling a dummy, dummy?"

JAKE: God, this is sad.

AMIR: [laughing] Fatass loves it.



JAKE: Raise your hand if you like Amir.

[Nobody reacts. Amir eventually raises his hand.]



AMIR: All's I'm saying is for a sport to be exciting, there should be points, you know? None of this low-scoring, tie-game bullshit--

[Everybody stands and celebrates.]

ALL: Goal! / Oh, awesome! / Oh yeah! / Woo!

AMIR: Why does this keep happening to me?



RACHEL: I think soccer players are the hottest.

AMIR: Gay much?

JAKE: What?

AMIR: Sorry, I thought Pat said that.



AMIR: Why is it, on airplanes, they give you little tiny napkins with your drink? What are they, afraid I'm gonna spill?

PAUL: ...Yes.

AMIR: Whatever. My point still stands.

JAKE: No it doesn't.

AMIR: Yes it does! I'm just saying I don't spill shit.

[Amir tries to grab a drink, but knocks it over with his hand.]

AMIR: Oh, sh--



AMIR: Sorry, am I being a dumbass American for preferring baseball to this "game"? I mean, baseball might be twice as slow and pretty boring, but at least shit happens--

[Everybody starts celebrating again.]

ALL: Goal! / Awesome!

AMIR: Fuck, dude! This is more than a coincidence! This is so bizarre! I'm, like, freaking out! Every time I bring up the low-scoring nature of the game, which it--

ALL: Goal! / Oh my God! / What!

AMIR: How?



JAKE: Oh, man.

AMIR: That was fun, actually! When's the next match?

JAKE: It's over, man. That was the final.

AMIR: So what now? Should we watch the MLS?

PAUL: No, we're good.

PAT: See you in four years, everyone.

JAKE: Cool.

[Everybody gets up to leave.]

AMIR: What?
