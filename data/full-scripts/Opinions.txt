INTRO:

AMIR: Oy, you're watching Jake and Amir, and we filmed this in Spain! (somewhat Australian accent)

JAKE: Wow.



[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks.]

AMIR: Jake, I am about to say something that's gonna blow your mind. Give me like, ten minutes.

(The video cuts to a black screen with text that says TEN MINUTES LATER.)

AMIR: Ekaj.

JAKE: My name backwards. Clever.

AMIR: What?

JAKE: You know what, man?

AMIR: For sure, for sure.

JAKE: No, I haven't said anything yet.

AMIR: I know, absolutely.

JAKE: I love baseball.

AMIR: (in a silly voice) I love baseball. (laughs). Yeah, I love baseballs. I love all the baseballs too, so.

JAKE: Derek Jeter?

AMIR: Yeah?

JAKE: My all-time favorite player.

AMIR: Yeah. My-he's-me-the-bom--he's the bomb. At his position, for his price, he's the number-one bomb.

JAKE: I hate Derek Jeter.

AMIR: I hate him. I hate.. him. He's like--ugh, nobody; the only person who hates him more than you is me, and that's saying a lot.. of.. stuff--

JAKE: I like him.

AMIR: He's good. I like him just fine, I was just.. Once you think about it you start to like him more and then I started to think about him and nowIllowIllike him.

JAKE: I hate ice cream.

AMIR: It tastes like a mouth.. it's like a mouthfull of buttholes in my mouth. It tastes like acid.

JAKE: I think it's delicious.

AMIR: I think it tastes like delicious acid.

JAKE: It tastes like ass.

AMIR: Yeah, I think it tastes like delicious ass, is what I meant.

JAKE: No, in a bad way.

AMIR: I said acid but I meant--Yeah in a bad way, an awful way--I mean, can you--(raising his voice in frustration) for crying out loudly, can you STOP?!

JAKE: ...Stop doing what?

AMIR: You keep like chan- I dunno you're like a flip-flopper and then I can't decide what I like, because you're always all over the place.

JAKE: Cuz you need to base your opinions off of mine.

AMIR: Yes.

JAKE: Because you don't have any thoughts or opinions of your own.

AMIR: Right, obviously.

JAKE: And you think that stealing mine is--

AMIR: Yes, when I steal yours it makes us better friends because we have the same opinion, I mean what don't you GET?

JAKE: I don't get why you're being so honest about it.

AMIR: (exasperated) Oh, my g--(sarcastic) Okay, let me formulate my own opinions, right? And then maybe if they match we can POSSIBLY bes- I mean just listen to myself it sounds like CRAZY--

END.
