[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks] 

(Girl comes up behind Jake and puts her arms around him) 

Jake: (moans  laughs) What's up dude? 

Girl: Hey. 

Jake (puts arms up): Tickle me. (Girl tickles Jake) (laughs) Ah man. 

(Girl leaves) 

Jake: See ya. 

Amir: What was that? 

Jake: What? 

Amir: What? Are you ticklish all of a sudden? 

Jake: What's the big deal? 

Amir: Nothing... I have to go to the bathroom. (gets up and walks away) 

(Amir stands up behind Jake's chair and puts his arms around Jake) 

Jake (thinking its the same girl): Hey, you're back? (looks around to see that it's Amir and pushes him away) Wha- What the fuck is the matter with you? 

Amir: So you're not ticklish!
