JAKE: Hey, I just got this uh, cool new thing in uh, this cool new program that does like green screen effects, and I'm on a roller coaster right now. (Puts his hands up and screams as though he's riding the roller coaster). AAAAAHHHHH HELP ME!! Haaha, oh man this is--

AMIR: (Coming into view from the side, yelling very loudly) HOLY SHITTTTTT!!!! AAAHHH!!! AAAAAAAHH!!!! AAEEHHHHH!!- (Putting his arm around Jake from behind) I CAN SEE MY HOUSEE!!!!--

JAKE: (Pushing Amir off of him) COME ON!
