INTRO
AMIR: Hey, welcome to Jake and Amir, and if you think this is funny, [chuckles] keep watchin'!
JAKE: Oh my-- you suck.
[Jake is at his desk. Amir enters and sits down.]
AMIR: You're driving down the road; make sure to pay... the scroll!
[Amir unrolls a very thin, fragile-looking scroll. Jake doesn't react.]
AMIR: I got the cure for the common scroll!
[Jake still doesn't react.]
AMIR: Stop being such an ass-scroll.
JAKE: You know, I'm trying this new thing... where I ignore you, to see if that makes you--
AMIR: [reading from the scroll] "Top ten ways to celebrate this country's birthday, AKA: the Fourth of Julay!"
JAKE: Can you please not read to me from that flimsy, shitty little scroll?
AMIR: "Number ten:" [Jake shakes his head] "sit in a den! With the lights real dim by the couch that you're lying, nobody can tell that your eyes have been crying."
JAKE: What are you talking about? Are you sad?
AMIR: I'm not sad! I'm devastated! "Number nine: laying supine! You're flat on the floor, calling your mother a whore through a more-than-locked door! Tears pour down my cheek because news flash: I'm weak!"
[In the background, Paul can be heard yelling at Will (see Jake and Amir: Password)[1] . Amir looks up from his scroll, and he and Jake look around for the source of the commotion.]
PAUL: Enough. Enough, enough! Leave this office!
WILL: I can't! I can't, I can't!
[Jake turns his attention back to Amir.]
JAKE: Are you okay?
AMIR: I'm more than okay! I'm devastated! "Number eight: the food's been great! I don't mean to get rambly, but why don't you just have a barbecue with your fambly?"
JAKE: Fine. You know what? That one's nice. Stop reading the list. I responded to one; I'll follow it--
AMIR: "Number seven: whoa, have a nice time in Heaven! You thought that burger was bison? Nah. That burger was ricin! With a patty this thick, it can sedate a family of sick! And mamma mia, I've dumped a bottle of Visine in the sangria! Clear eyes, full farts? Can't booze!"
JAKE: You absolute monster, you're talking about poisoning your family.
AMIR: "Number six: I can fix this. '911? My dad's real sick! He's OD'd on Visine; it's the worst case that I've seen! Ohhh! You'll send an ambulance? That's perfect! Oh, what's my address? Sorry, motherfucker, you'll have to guess! Yeah!'"
JAKE: You depraved lunatic! Okay, you're talking about calling an ambulance in front of your dying family, and then not giving the EMT team the directions to your house? You'll-- you'll go to jail for that! I think you'd go to jail for even writing that!
AMIR: Oh no! Jail! Well, I have a plan that won't fail. "Number five: 'Keep me alive! I don't want your death penalty, Your Honor! It was a simple mistake! Does your yard need to be raked?'"
JAKE: Great, so your "plan that won't fail" is to publicly bribe a judge, [Amir grins smugly as Jake speaks] in a court of law, with a task that could easily do himself?
AMIR: "Number four: 'This yard work's a bore! I don't wanna do this chore!'"
JAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?
AMIR: "Number three:"
JAKE: Holy shit...
AMIR: "...fireworks for me! Head down to the local docks and watch the red, white, and blue o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Our ancestors fought, bled, and even died for this country, and the least we can do is take a moment to celebrate their effort, to cherish what we have. Even if life isn't perfect-- you know, 'cause let's face it, whose is?-- just sit down and reflect. You know, you can make anything you want for yourself, and that's what America is; that's what makes it the greatest country in the world!"
JAKE: Okay. ...Okay!
AMIR: "Number two: take a poo. Right down there on the docks that you've been reflecting on, too! George Washington, you dreamy, dreamy oaf. Now lay down, open your mouth, and swallow my steamy, steamy loaf."
JAKE: ...I think you need to die.
[Amir makes a confused face.]
JAKE: Yeah.
AMIR: ...Excuse me?
JAKE: It's been six years, and you're getting worse. Okay? I think the world would just be... an infinitely better place if you weren't in it.
AMIR: Okay, [chuckles feebly] uh, "number one--"
JAKE: No. You shouldn't be allowed to breathe.
[Amir sits in silence, obviously hurt. He smiles weakly at Jake.]
AMIR: [choking up] Please let me finish.
JAKE: Please finish your life.
AMIR: You're upsetting me, dude--
JAKE: Be dead!
AMIR: [choking up] Uhhh, whoa-- [sobs, grabs his chest] --something's happening. I can't even-- I don't even know if I can finish the list at this point, because I am [sobs] short of breath or something! [sobbing, stammering] What d-- what d-- what d-- what did you do with this-- you put some weird, like, hex on me or something--
JAKE: No, you're just crying.
AMIR: [still crying] No, I'm more than crying! I'm like-- [sobbing to the point of hyperventilation] I don't know! It's indescribable, I'm like... [breaks down]
JAKE: Okay, well then you're sobbing.
AMIR: [still crying] No, n-- what is that? What is sobbing? I'm like-- [sobs] --scared-- [sobs] --and-- [breaks down again]
JAKE: Okay, why don't you just go home, okay?
AMIR: [still crying] I can't go home; I think-- I think I'll die in the subway, I'm like-- [sobbing uncontrollably] ...what did you do to me? You witch doctor!
JAKE: Just because I made you cry, you think I cast a spell on you?
AMIR: [still crying] Yeah! That's exactly what it is! You demon! You sorcerer! What is this black magic--
JAKE: Okay, I was kidding, alright?
[Amir immediately stops.]
AMIR: Oh... thank gosh.
JAKE: Holy shit.
AMIR: That was...
[Amir, shaken and seemingly lost for words, can't finish the sentence. Eventually he picks the scroll back up and resumes as if nothing had happened.]
AMIR: "--have fun in the sun..."
JAKE: Jesus.
